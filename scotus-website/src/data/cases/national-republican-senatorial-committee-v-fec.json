Applying the closely drawn scrutiny framework from McCutcheon v. FEC, the Court finds that political parties coordinating with their own candidates do not present the circumvention risk that contribution limits address, the 2014 statutory amendments creating exceptions for convention, headquarters, and legal proceeding coordination demonstrate Congress’s own recognition that coordination does not inherently corrupt, and twenty-eight states’ experience with unlimited party coordination refutes the speculative corruption theory underlying Colorado II.",
