Under the major questions doctrine, decisions of vast economic and political significance require clear congressional authorization. Because IEEPA provides no such authorization, and because reading it to authorize unlimited tariffs would render Trade Act § 122 superfluous and raise serious nondelegation concerns, the Court holds that the President exceeded statutory authority.",
