Following Geders v. United States and Perry v. Leeke, the Court reaffirms that during overnight recesses defendants have an unqualified right to unrestricted access to counsel for consultation about all trial-related matters, including the defendant's ongoing testimony. The Sixth Amendment's guarantee of Assistance of Counsel requires that defendants be able to consult with their attorneys about tactical decisions during these intensive work periods, and trial courts may not impose content-based restrictions that categorically prohibit discussion of testimony while permitting discussion of other trial matters.",

At the Founding, the right to counsel meant active help and support, not mere physical presence. Historical practice shows no evidence of courts prohibiting attorney-client consultation during overnight recesses, and the absence of this practice strongly suggests the restriction violates original meaning.

Ethical rules already draw this distinction, and trial courts can enforce these boundaries through tailored restrictions.",

Trial courts retain authority to sequester defendants from other witnesses and warn counsel about ethical obligations, but cannot prohibit testimony-related consultation. During brief courtroom recesses (under 1-2 hours), Perry's framework continues to apply, and trial courts may impose reasonable restrictions including prohibiting testimony discussions to preserve immediate trial continuity. For intermediate recesses (2-6 hours), courts should err toward permitting consultation for recesses exceeding 2-3 hours."
