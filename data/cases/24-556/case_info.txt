Fernandez v. United States (No. 24-556)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Can a federal prisoner use the compassionate release law to get their
   sentence reduced based on claims that they might be innocent or that
   their sentence is unfair, even though these same claims would normally
   have to be raised through habeas corpus?

BACKGROUND:
Joe Fernandez participated as a backup shooter in a 2000 murder-for-hire
scheme in the Bronx. On February 22, 2000, Patrick Darge hired him to help
kill Arturo Cuellar and Idelfonso Vivero Flores, two Mexican drug cartel
members who had come to New York City to collect approximately $6.5 million
owed by drug trafficker Jeffrey Minaya for 274 kilograms of cocaine. When
Darge's gun jammed after shooting Cuellar in the head, Fernandez fired
fourteen shots in the apartment building lobby, nine hitting the victims. He
received $40,000 for his participation. After eleven years on the run,
Fernandez surrendered to police in October 2011. Unlike his co-defendants
who pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government, Fernandez proceeded
to trial in 2013. The government's key witness was Patrick Darge, who
admitted during cross-examination to lying to authorities in previous cases.
Despite this admission, the jury convicted Fernandez of participating in a
murder-for-hire conspiracy resulting in two deaths and aiding and abetting
the use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence. In October
2014, he received a mandatory life sentence, while his cooperating co-
defendants received significantly lighter sentences: Darge (30 years), Reyes
(25 years), Minaya (15 years), and Rivera (2 years). The U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York originally sentenced Fernandez, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction on
direct appeal in 2016. In 2021, the district court vacated one of his
convictions but left the mandatory life sentence intact. When Fernandez
filed a compassionate release motion citing his possible innocence and
sentencing disparity, the district court granted it in 2022, but the Second
Circuit reversed this decision.
