Villarreal v. Texas (No. 24-557)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a trial court violate a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by
   preventing the defendant and his lawyer from discussing the defendant’s
   testimony during an overnight break in the trial?

BACKGROUND:
David Asa Villarreal was charged with murder in Bexar County, Texas. During
his trial, Villarreal took the stand in his own defense shortly before a
planned midday recess. Because Villarreal was still in the middle of his
direct examination when the court adjourned for an overnight recess, the
trial judge instructed his attorneys not to confer with him regarding his
ongoing testimony but permitted them to discuss other trial-related matters.
Villarreal’s lead counsel objected to this limitation under the Sixth
Amendment but otherwise indicated understanding of the court's directive.
The next day, Villarreal resumed his testimony, and no further objections
about the limitation were raised. Villarreal was ultimately convicted and
sentenced to sixty years in prison. Following his conviction, Villarreal
appealed, arguing that the trial court’s restriction violated his Sixth
Amendment right to counsel. A divided appeals court affirmed his conviction,
and Villarreal petitioned for discretionary review, and the Court of
Criminal Appeals of Texas held that the trial judge’s limited no-conferral
order did not violate Villarreal’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
