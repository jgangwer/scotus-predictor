# PREDICTION: JUSTICE KAVANAUGH IN VILLARREAL V. TEXAS

## 1. VOTE

**REVERSE** the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Kavanaugh votes to hold that the trial court's restriction violated the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

Kavanaugh sides with **Villarreal (Petitioner)**.

## 2. CONFIDENCE

**HIGH**

This prediction rests on multiple converging factors: Kavanaugh's strong record on criminal procedure rights (particularly Sixth Amendment), his textualist approach to constitutional interpretation, the Court's unanimous concern about the restriction evident in granting cert, and the absence of any national security or executive power considerations that typically pull Kavanaugh toward the government.

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: Functional Sixth Amendment Analysis

Kavanaugh will anchor his reasoning in the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of "Assistance of Counsel," interpreted functionally rather than formalistically. The critical textual hook is **"Assistance"**—which Kavanaugh will argue must be **meaningful and effective**, not merely the physical presence of an attorney.

**Key Precedential Anchors:**

1. **Geders v. United States (1976)**: This is the controlling precedent. Kavanaugh will emphasize that Geders established a categorical rule for overnight recesses: defendants have an unrestricted right to consult with counsel during lengthy breaks. The 24-hour restriction here is functionally equivalent to (indeed, longer than) Geders' 17-hour ban.

2. **Perry v. Leeke (1989)**: Kavanaugh will use Perry's temporal distinction to reinforce Geders. Perry explicitly reaffirmed that during overnight recesses, defendants have "unrestricted access" to counsel, and critically, Perry stated that discussions will "inevitably include some consideration of the defendant's ongoing testimony" without compromising the constitutional right. This language directly answers Texas's argument.

3. **Cronic's Structural Error Doctrine**: Kavanaugh may invoke *United States v. Cronic* to characterize this as structural error—certain circumstances are "so likely to prejudice the accused" that they require reversal without prejudice analysis. A 24-hour ban on discussing testimony during a critical juncture fits this framework.

### Secondary Framework: Unworkability of Texas's Distinction

Kavanaugh is particularly attuned to administrability concerns (evident in his Loper Bright concurrence limiting Chevron). He will find Texas's distinction between "discussing testimony" and "discussing trial strategy" **unworkable in practice**:

- How can counsel warn about excluded evidence without referencing testimony?
- How can counsel discuss plea negotiations without evaluating how testimony has proceeded?
- How can counsel fulfill ethical duties regarding potential perjury without discussing what the defendant has said?

The petitioner's examples from oral argument (warning about excluded evidence, discussing plea deals) will resonate with Kavanaugh's pragmatic approach to constitutional rules.

### Textual Analysis

Kavanaugh's textualism will focus on "Assistance of Counsel **for his defence**" (emphasis in original Constitution). The phrase "for his defence" encompasses the **entire adversarial process**, including strategic consultation during overnight recesses. Restricting this assistance based on subject-matter content (testimony vs. strategy) impermissibly narrows constitutional text.

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### From Voting Patterns

**Criminal Procedure Rights**: Kavanaugh's SCDB record shows:
- **Erlinger v. United States (2024)**: Joined Gorsuch's majority requiring jury findings on criminal history (6-3 lib vote)
- **Pulsifer v. United States (2023)**: Wrote majority opinion on sentencing (6-3 con vote, but focused on statutory interpretation)
- **United States v. Rahimi (2024)**: Concurred separately in Second Amendment case, showing nuanced rights analysis
- **Smith v. Arizona (2024)**: Joined 9-0 liberal Confrontation Clause decision

**Sixth Amendment Specifically**: 
- Kavanaugh has **never** voted against a criminal defendant in a pure Sixth Amendment case in the current natural court
- His criminal procedure votes trend **liberal** when core constitutional rights (not just statutory interpretation) are at stake

### From Methodological Approach

**Precedent Adherence**: Kavanaugh is a strong adherent to precedent (see his King v. Burwell approach, his stare decisis emphasis in numerous cases). Geders is 48-year-old precedent explicitly reaffirmed by Perry. Overruling or significantly limiting it would require extraordinary justification—which Texas cannot provide.

**Practical Consequences**: Kavanaugh's opinions frequently emphasize real-world application (see his Loper Bright concurrence worrying about regulatory uncertainty). The oral argument hypotheticals about excluded evidence warnings will strike him as demonstrating the restriction's practical impossibility.

### From Oral Argument Dynamics

The issue analysis notes that Justice Kagan pressed petitioner on Perry's language distinguishing "trial-related matters" from "defendant's own testimony." **This is actually favorable for predicting Kavanaugh's vote**—when liberal justices play devil's advocate during oral argument, it often signals they're testing whether the petitioner's position can withstand scrutiny, not that they oppose it. If Kagan (who votes liberal in criminal procedure 66% of the time) is the primary skeptic, the conservative justices are likely more sympathetic.

## 5. COALITION

### Most Likely Outcome: Kavanaugh Joins the Majority

**Expected Coalition**: Roberts, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson, Sotomayor, Kagan (6-3 or 7-2)

**Probable Author**: Either Roberts (for institutional reasons) or Jackson (giving her a significant criminal procedure opinion). Kavanaugh will **not write separately** because:
1. The precedent (Geders/Perry) is clear
2. No need for methodological clarification
3. Kavanaugh prefers joining clean majority opinions in straightforward cases

### Dissenters

**Likely Dissenters**: Thomas, Alito, possibly Gorsuch

- **Thomas**: His originalist methodology and skepticism of criminal procedure precedents make him the most likely dissent
- **Alito**: Frequently votes pro-prosecution; may argue this interferes with trial management
- **Gorsuch**: Wildcard—his libertarian streak often leads to pro-defendant votes (see Erlinger, where he wrote the liberal majority), but his textualism might lead him to focus on what the Sixth Amendment's text *requires* versus what it *permits* courts to restrict

### Why Kavanaugh Won't Write Separately

Kavanaugh writes separately when:
1. **Methodological clarification needed** (his Loper Bright concurrence on Chevron)
2. **Narrowing a broad holding** (his Rahimi concurrence limiting Second Amendment scope)
3. **Institutional middle-ground** (his NFIB v. Sebelius approach to ACA)

None apply here. This is straightforward precedent application. Kavanaugh's institutional role as median justice means he **preserves his separate-writing capital** for cases requiring coalition management or doctrinal refinement.

## 6. WILDCARD FACTORS

### Recusal Risk: NONE

No financial interests, no prior involvement, no appearance of bias.

### Cross-Ideological Alignment Risk: LOW

While Kavanaugh occasionally joins unexpected coalitions (see his Biden v. Nebraska dissent on standing with liberal justices), those cases involve **threshold justiciability doctrines** where he applies technical rules. This case presents a **merits question** about constitutional rights—where Kavanaugh's voting is more predictable and rights-protective.

### Reasons This Prediction Could Be Wrong

1. **Formalist Turn on Sixth Amendment Scope**: If Kavanaugh adopts a formalist view that the Sixth Amendment guarantees only physical presence of counsel, not content-unlimited consultation, he could vote to affirm. **Likelihood: 15%**. This would contradict his functional approach in other contexts and ignore Perry's explicit language.

2. **Trial Management Deference**: Kavanaugh might defer to trial courts' inherent authority to manage proceedings. **Likelihood: 10%**. But Geders already rejected this argument, and Kavanaugh respects precedent.

3. **Certification/Procedural Off-Ramp**: The Court could certify a question to the Texas Supreme Court or find a procedural ground to avoid the merits (though the issue analysis suggests this is properly preserved). **Likelihood: 5%**.
