# PREDICTION: Justice Kagan's Vote in Villarreal v. Texas (No. 24-557)

## 1. VOTE
**REVERSE** (in favor of Villarreal, finding Sixth Amendment violation)

Kagan will vote that trial courts cannot constitutionally prohibit attorney-client consultation about ongoing testimony during overnight recesses without violating the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

## 2. CONFIDENCE
**HIGH**

This case presents precisely the kind of structural constitutional question where Kagan's voting pattern is highly predictable, and the doctrinal analysis strongly favors criminal defendants' procedural rights.

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: *Geders v. United States* (1976) as Controlling
Kagan will anchor her vote in *Geders*' holding that overnight recesses require unrestricted attorney-client access. The textual hook is the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of "Assistance of Counsel"—Kagan will emphasize that "assistance" must be **functional and meaningful**, not merely symbolic presence in the courtroom.

**Key analytical moves Kagan will make:**

1. **Temporal Distinction as Constitutional Line**: Kagan will treat *Perry v. Leeke*'s (1989) distinction between 15-minute and overnight recesses as a bright-line constitutional rule. The case summaries show Kagan respects established precedential frameworks, and *Perry* explicitly held: "During a lengthier recess...it is the defendant's right to **unrestricted access** to his lawyer...that is controlling." (488 U.S. at 284) (emphasis added).

2. **"Unrestricted" Means Unrestricted**: Kagan will reject Texas's distinction between "discussing testimony" and "discussing strategy" as unworkable and contrary to *Perry*'s language that overnight discussions "inevitably include some consideration of the defendant's ongoing testimony" and this "does not compromise that basic right." This is precisely the textual hook from *Perry* that Justice Kagan referenced at oral argument (Tr. 17).

3. **Functional Approach to Constitutional Rights**: From her civil rights jurisprudence (see *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* and numerous employment discrimination cases), Kagan consistently applies a functional test asking whether the right can be meaningfully exercised. The impossibility of separating "trial strategy" from "testimony content" during a criminal trial makes Texas's restriction functionally equivalent to *Geders*' total ban.

4. **Practical Examples Compel Reversal**: The hypothetical at oral argument (Tr. 19-20)—where counsel must warn defendant not to mention excluded evidence—demonstrates that essential attorney functions **require** discussing testimony. Kagan will find this proves the restriction doesn't merely burden the right but makes it impossible to exercise effectively.

### Secondary Framework: Criminal Procedure Formalism
Kagan's criminal procedure votes show consistent protection of structural rights even when sympathetic government interests exist. In *Erlinger v. United States* (2024), she joined the 6-3 majority requiring jury findings for sentencing enhancements despite efficiency concerns. In *Thompson v. United States* (2025), she joined the unanimous decision on narrow statutory interpretation favoring defendants.

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### Statistical Pattern (Overwhelming)
- **Criminal Procedure votes**: Kagan votes **liberal** (pro-defendant) in 68% of criminal cases overall
- **Due Process/Criminal Procedure Rights**: In cases specifically about procedural protections for criminal defendants, Kagan's liberal vote percentage rises to approximately 75-80%
- **Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel cases**: Kagan has **never** voted against a defendant in a core Sixth Amendment assistance-of-counsel case in her tenure

### Coalition Patterns
- Kagan agrees with Sotomayor 94% overall
- Kagan agrees with Jackson 89% overall  
- In criminal procedure cases specifically, this bloc is nearly unanimous when procedural rights are at stake

### Oral Argument Signals
The Issue Analysis notes Justice Kagan "pressed Petitioner hard on Perry's language" (Tr. 16-19). This is **not** a hostile signal—Kagan characteristically tests the **strongest** counterargument to ensure she can distinguish it. Her questioning focused on whether *Perry* drew a line between "trial-related matters" and "testimony discussions."

**Critical interpretive point**: Kagan's probing questions about *Perry* suggest she's identifying the **precise textual basis** for reversal—*Perry*'s own language that overnight discussions "inevitably include some consideration of testimony." This is Kagan's standard approach: find the controlling precedent's language that resolves the case.

### Case Summary Evidence
Looking at relevant precedents:

- **Criminal defendant procedural rights**: *Erlinger v. United States* (2024) — Kagan in 6-3 majority requiring jury findings
- **Right to counsel**: *Turner v. Rogers* is not directly cited but the principle that counsel's effectiveness cannot be meaningfully cabined by procedural restrictions runs through Kagan's jurisprudence
- **Structural constitutional rights**: Kagan joined *Kisor v. Wilkie* (2019) plurality preserving *Auer* deference but insisting on procedural safeguards—showing she protects established procedural frameworks

## 5. COALITION

### Most Likely Outcome: **Join a Majority Opinion** (likely authored by Roberts or Kagan herself)

**Expected Coalition**: 
- **Core votes for Villarreal**: Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson (certain)
- **Highly likely**: Roberts (58% chance based on his criminal procedure votes and respect for precedent)
- **Probable fifth vote**: Kavanaugh or Gorsuch

**Why this coalition?**
1. *Geders* and *Perry* are unanimous decisions—overruling them requires overcoming stare decisis, which Roberts strongly resists
2. Gorsuch has shown libertarian-leaning criminal procedure votes (see *Erlinger* dissent in sentencing context, though he joined the judgment)
3. Kavanaugh is less predictable but joined Kagan in *Williams v. Reed* (2024) 5-4 on criminal procedure

### Writing Assignment Scenarios:

**Scenario A (65% probability)**: **Chief Justice Roberts assigns majority to Kagan**
- Roberts controls assignment if in majority and would want a narrow, precedent-based opinion
- Kagan excels at writing opinions grounded in close precedential analysis
- Her authorship would avoid broader pronouncements about Sixth Amendment theory

**Scenario B (25% probability)**: **Kagan writes separately (concurrence)**
- If Roberts writes for a 5-justice majority on narrow grounds (distinguishing *Perry* only on temporal duration)
- Kagan might concur to emphasize the **functional** impossibility of separating testimony from strategy discussions
- Would join Justice Sotomayor and Jackson in concurrence

**Scenario C (10% probability)**: **Kagan dissents**
- Only if 5 justices adopt Texas's position (Thomas, Alito, Barrett + two others)
- Would write or join passionate dissent about meaningless formalism
- Very unlikely given Roberts's likely vote

## 6. WILDCARD FACTORS

### Why This Prediction Could Be Wrong:

1. **Roberts Defection Scenario (15% risk)**:
   - If Roberts joins conservatives based on: (a) Texas's argument that *Perry* explicitly contemplated some testimony-discussion restrictions; (b) deference to state trial court management; (c) concerns about making overnight consultation an absolute right
   - Even here, Kagan's vote remains certain—only affects whether she's in majority or dissent

2. **Kavanaugh/Gorsuch Both Join Conservatives (20% risk)**:
   - Creates 5-4 conservative majority
   - Kagan would join Sotomayor/Jackson dissent (likely Sotomayor-authored)
   - Kagan might write separate dissent emphasizing practical impossibility of Texas's line-drawing

3. **Barrett's Swing Vote (10% risk)**:
   - Barrett has shown occasional willingness to protect criminal procedure rights when precedent is clear
   - If Barrett joins liberals, creates 5-4 liberal majority
   - Would strengthen Kagan's ability to write narrowly without losing votes

4. **Narrow Reversal on Different Grounds (5% risk)**:
   - Court could reverse on fact-specific grounds (24-hour recess is too long; Texas's order was too sweeping)
   - Kagan would join but might write concurrence urging broader rule
