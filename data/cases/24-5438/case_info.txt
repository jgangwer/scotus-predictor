Bowe v. United States (No. 24-5438)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
1. Does a rule requiring dismissal of repeat claims in state prisoner habeas
   petitions also apply to repeat claims in federal prisoner motions to
   vacate their sentences? 2. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review
   lower court decisions allowing or denying federal prisoners permission to
   file repeat challenges to their sentences?

BACKGROUND:
In 2008, Michael Bowe was charged with conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act
robbery, attempted Hobbs Act robbery, and using a firearm during a crime of
violence. He pleaded guilty in 2009 and received a 288-month sentence, which
included a mandatory consecutive 120-month term for the firearm conviction
under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). Starting in 2016, Bowe made multiple attempts to
challenge his § 924(c) conviction through a series of motions and
applications, arguing that changes in Supreme Court precedent (particularly
Johnson v. United States and United States v. Davis) meant that his
underlying crimes no longer qualified as “crimes of violence” that could
support the firearm conviction. The district court initially denied Bowe’s
first § 2255 motion in 2016, finding that attempted Hobbs Act robbery still
qualified as a crime of violence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit then denied several subsequent applications from Bowe to file
additional challenges, ultimately concluding in that it lacked jurisdiction
to consider his latest application because he was attempting to raise the
same claim he had already presented in previous applications.
