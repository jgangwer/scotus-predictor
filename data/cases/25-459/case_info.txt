Salazar v. Paramount Global (No. 25-459)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does the phrase “goods or services from a video tape service provider,” as
   used in the Video Privacy Protection Act’s definition of “consumer,”
   refer to all of a video tape service provider’s goods or services or only
   to its audiovisual goods or services?

BACKGROUND:
Michael Salazar subscribed to an online newsletter from 247Sports.com in
2022, a website owned by Paramount Global that covers college sports
recruiting. While logged into his Facebook account, Salazar watched videos
on the 247Sports.com website. Paramount had installed Facebook’s tracking
Pixel on the website, which collected and transmitted to Facebook
information about Salazar’s video-viewing activity, including the video
content name, its URL, and Salazar's Facebook ID. This disclosure allegedly
occurred without Salazar’s knowledge or consent. In September 2022, Salazar
filed a class action lawsuit against Paramount Global in the U.S. District
Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, claiming violations of the Video
Privacy Protection Act (VPPA). The district court denied Paramount’s motion
to dismiss for lack of standing but granted its motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim, holding that Salazar was not a “consumer” under
the VPPA because his newsletter subscription did not qualify as subscribing
to audiovisual goods or services. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed the dismissal.
