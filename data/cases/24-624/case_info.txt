Case v. Montana (No. 24-624)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
May law enforcement enter a home without a search warrant based on less than
   probable cause that an emergency is occurring?

BACKGROUND:
In September 2021, Trevor Case’s ex-girlfriend J.H. called police to report
that Case had threatened suicide during their phone conversation. J.H.
believed Case was intoxicated due to his erratic behavior, and she became
alarmed when he mentioned getting “a note or something like that” before
committing suicide. During the call, J.H. heard clicking sounds resembling a
cocking pistol, prompting her to tell Case she would call police. Case
responded by threatening to harm any officers who came to his home. The call
ended when J.H. heard a “pop” that she believed was a gunshot, followed by
dead air, though the line remained connected. Unable to get Case to respond,
J.H. contacted police and drove to his residence. Law enforcement officers
arrived at Case’s home and attempted to make contact by knocking on doors
and calling through an open window, but received no response. Through the
windows, officers observed empty beer cans, an empty handgun holster, and a
notepad they believed contained a suicide note. The officers knew of Case’s
history of alcohol abuse, mental health issues, and previous suicide
threats, including an incident where he brought a weapon to the school where
he taught. After approximately forty minutes on scene, officers made the
decision to enter the home without a warrant to conduct a welfare check.
They entered with weapons drawn due to J.H.’s report of Case's threats
against officers. While clearing the home, Sergeant Pasha encountered Case
in an upstairs bedroom closet. When Case suddenly opened the closet curtain,
Pasha observed what he believed was a dark object at Case’s waist and shot
him in the abdomen. A handgun was subsequently found in a laundry hamper
next to where Case fell. Case was charged with Assault on a Peace Officer
and filed pretrial motions to suppress evidence obtained from the
warrantless entry. The district court denied the motion to suppress.
Following a jury trial in December 2022, Case was convicted of the felony
charge. Case appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, which affirmed.
