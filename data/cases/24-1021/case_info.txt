Galette v. New Jersey Transit  Corp. (No. 24-1021)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Is the New Jersey Transit Corporation an arm of the State of New Jersey for
   interstate sovereign immunity purposes?

BACKGROUND:
In August 2018, Cedric Galette was a passenger in a vehicle stopped on
Market Street in Philadelphia when it was struck by a vehicle operated by
the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit). Galette suffered physical
injuries as a result of the collision and brought a negligence lawsuit in
Pennsylvania state court against both the vehicle’s driver, Julie McCrey,
and NJ Transit. NJ Transit responded by asserting that it was an arm of the
State of New Jersey, and therefore immune from private suit in Pennsylvania
under the doctrine of interstate sovereign immunity. The trial court denied
NJ Transit’s motion to dismiss, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court
affirmed, holding that NJ Transit is not an arm of New Jersey. The Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania reversed, holding that NJ Transit qualifies as an arm
of the state and is therefore immune under the doctrine of interstate
sovereign immunity.
