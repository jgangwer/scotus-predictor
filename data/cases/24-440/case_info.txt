Berk v. Choy (No. 24-440)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Must a Delaware law providing that a complaint must be dismissed unless it
   is accompanied by an expert affidavit be enforced by a federal court
   sitting in diversity?

BACKGROUND:
Harold R. Berk injured his ankle and allegedly received negligent medical
care from three healthcare providers: Dr. Wilson C. Choy, Beebe Medical
Center, Inc., and Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Middletown,
LLC. Believing he suffered harm due to their malpractice, Berk filed a
lawsuit against them under Delaware law. Like many states, Delaware requires
plaintiffs in medical negligence cases to submit an affidavit of merit
(AOM)—a statement from a qualified expert certifying that the lawsuit has a
reasonable basis—either with the complaint or within a short time after
filing. Berk failed to submit an AOM with his complaint and did not request
an extension before the deadline passed. Because the Delaware statute treats
the AOM requirement as mandatory, the district court dismissed his case.
Berk appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which
affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the Delaware AOM statute is
substantive and therefore must be enforced by a federal court sitting in
diversity.
