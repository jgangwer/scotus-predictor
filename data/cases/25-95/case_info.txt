Pung v. Isabella County (No. 25-95)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
1. When the government takes property for tax debt, does the Fifth Amendment
   require compensation based on the property’s true fair market value, or
   only on the lower amount it sold for at a tax foreclosure auction? 2.
   Does the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause prohibit the
   government from seizing and keeping a property worth far more than the
   small tax debt owed on it?

BACKGROUND:
This case involves a dispute over the foreclosure and sale of the Pung
property in Isabella County, Michigan, following the death of its owner,
Timothy Scott Pung, in 2004. The property had a Principal Residence
Exemption (PRE) from local school taxes. In 2010, the township tax assessor,
Patricia DePriest, retroactively denied the PRE for the years 2007-2009,
asserting a new owner must file an affidavit. Although the Michigan Tax
Tribunal overturned this decision in 2012, holding the PRE remained valid
for the estate, DePriest subsequently revoked the PRE for the 2012 tax year
based on the same unfiled-affidavit rationale. This denial created an unpaid
tax bill of $2,241.93. The County Treasurer, Steven Pickens, initiated
foreclosure proceedings for this delinquency. After a final judgment of
foreclosure, the property sold at a public auction for $76,008. Isabella
County and Pickens retained the entire $76,008 from the sale, refusing to
return the surplus proceeds above the tax debt to Michael Pung, the estate's
representative. Michael Pung sued, alleging this retention of the surplus
violated the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause and the Eighth Amendment’s
Excessive Fines Clause. The district court granted Pung summary judgment on
the Takings Clause claim, ruling he was entitled to the surplus proceeds
(the sale price minus the tax debt), but not to the greater loss in equity
based on the property’s fair market value. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment on all claims,
including the amount of compensation awarded.
