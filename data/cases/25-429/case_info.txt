Bondi v. Lau  (No. 25-429)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
To remove a lawful permanent resident who committed an offense listed in
   Section 1182(a)(2) and was subsequently paroled into the United States,
   must the government prove that it possessed clear and convincing evidence
   of the offense at the time of the lawful permanent resident’s last
   reentry into the United States?

BACKGROUND:
Muk Choi Lau, a native and citizen of China, was admitted to the United
States as a lawful permanent resident on September 7, 2007, after several
years of traveling to the country as a nonimmigrant. On May 7, 2012, Lau was
charged in New Jersey with third-degree trademark counterfeiting. While
awaiting trial, he left the United States for a brief period. Upon returning
on June 15, 2012, he presented himself at John F. Kennedy International
Airport as a returning lawful permanent resident. However, because of his
pending charge, immigration authorities declined to admit him outright and
instead paroled him into the country pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).
Over a year later, in June 2013, Lau pleaded guilty to the counterfeiting
charge and was sentenced to two years’ probation. The Department of Homeland
Security initiated removal proceedings against Lau in March 2014, charging
him with inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) for having
been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). Lau argued that
he should not have been treated as an arriving alien at the time of reentry
and that he was eligible for a discretionary waiver under 8 U.S.C. §
1182(h). The immigration judge rejected both claims, and the Board of
Immigration Appeals affirmed. Lau petitioned for review, arguing primarily
that DHS lacked clear and convincing evidence to treat him as an applicant
for admission on reentry merely due to a then-pending charge. The U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed, holding that DHS erred in treating
Lau as inadmissible based solely on unproven allegations at the time of
reentry and granted his petition. The immigration judge ordered removal in
2018, and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that decision in 2021. The
Second Circuit vacated the removal order in 2025 and remanded the case to
terminate proceedings under the inadmissibility ground, reserving the
possibility of future removal under a deportability provision.
