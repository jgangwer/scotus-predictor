Jules v. Andre Balazs Properties (No. 25-83)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a federal court that initially exercises jurisdiction and stays a case
   pending arbitration maintain jurisdiction over a post-arbitration Section
   9 or 10 application where jurisdiction would otherwise be lacking?

BACKGROUND:
Adrian Jules worked at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles until he was
fired in March 2020. In December 2020, he sued multiple individuals and
affiliated corporate entities in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, alleging discrimination and other claims under both
federal and state law. He invoked federal-question jurisdiction under Title
VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as diversity
jurisdiction. The defendants moved to compel arbitration based on an
agreement Jules signed with Chateau Marmont, which was not initially named
as a party. The district court stayed the litigation pending arbitration but
did not formally compel arbitration, as the agreement required arbitration
to occur in California, outside that court’s district. Jules proceeded to
arbitrate his claims against Chateau alone. The arbitrator ultimately ruled
against him on all claims and sanctioned him and his attorney for misconduct
during the arbitration. After the award, Jules returned to the district
court, seeking to vacate it, while Chateau and other defendants sought to
confirm it—even though some of them were not parties to the arbitration
proceeding. Jules argued that under the Supreme Court’s decision in Badgerow
v. Walters, the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to confirm
the award because the post-arbitration petitions, on their face, did not
establish federal jurisdiction. The U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York confirmed the award, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that because the court had jurisdiction
over the original, stayed lawsuit, it retained jurisdiction over subsequent
applications to confirm or vacate the arbitration award. That ruling
deepened a split among the courts of appeals, prompting the U.S. Supreme
Court to grant certiorari.
