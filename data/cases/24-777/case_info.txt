Urias-Orellana v. Bondi (No. 24-777)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Must a federal court of appeals defer to the BIA’s judgment that a given set
   of undisputed facts does not demonstrate mistreatment severe enough to
   constitute “persecution” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)?

BACKGROUND:
Douglas Humberto Urias-Orellana, a Salvadoran citizen, fled to the United
States with his wife and minor child after facing threats from Wilfredo, a
local hitman. The violence began in 2016 when Wilfredo shot and seriously
injured Urias-Orellana’s two half-brothers in separate incidents. Wilfredo
then vowed to kill their entire family. Over the next several years, Urias-
Orellana was repeatedly threatened at gunpoint by masked men demanding money
and warning they would harm him like his brothers. In December 2020, he was
physically assaulted in his hometown, with the attackers striking him three
times in the chest. To escape these threats, Urias-Orellana and his family
relocated multiple times within El Salvador. They lived peacefully in some
locations for extended periods but encountered problems when returning to
areas near his hometown. After noticing his attackers searching for him in
early 2021, the family entered the United States without authorization in
June 2021. The Department of Homeland Security charged Petitioners with
removability for illegal entry. They applied for asylum based on persecution
of their family group, with Urias-Orellana also seeking protection under the
Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge denied their applications,
finding the harm did not constitute persecution and that they could safely
relocate within El Salvador. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed,
leading to this petition for review before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit. The First Circuit denied the petition for review, upholding
the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision on all claims.
