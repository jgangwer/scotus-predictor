Bost v. Illinois State Board of Elections (No. 24-568)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Do federal candidates have Article III standing to challenge state laws that
   allow mail-in ballots to be received and counted for two weeks after
   Election Day based on claims that such laws dilute their votes and force
   them to incur additional campaign expenses for extended ballot
   monitoring?

BACKGROUND:
Michael Bost, a multi-term U.S. Representative from Illinois’s 12th
District, along with Laura Pollastrini and Susan Sweeney, political
activists who served as presidential electors in 2020, challenged Illinois’s
mail-in ballot receipt procedure. Under Illinois law, election officials can
receive and count mail-in ballots for up to fourteen days after Election Day
if the ballots are postmarked or certified by Election Day. Plaintiffs
argued this procedure violates federal election statutes by impermissibly
extending Election Day beyond the federally mandated date. They claimed the
counting of these “untimely” ballots dilutes their votes and forces them to
expend additional campaign resources to monitor ballot counting for two
weeks after Election Day. Plaintiffs filed suit in May 2022 against the
Illinois State Board of Elections and its Executive Director. The U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the case,
finding that Plaintiffs lacked Article III standing. The court also rejected
their claims on the merits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit affirmed the dismissal on jurisdictional grounds.
