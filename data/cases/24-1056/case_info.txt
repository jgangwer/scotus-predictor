Rico v. United States (No. 24-1056)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does the fugitive-tolling doctrine apply in the context of supervised
   release?

BACKGROUND:
In May 2018, Isabel Rico absconded from supervised release after serving
only five months of her 42-month term. Rico had originally been convicted in
the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and was
serving supervised release as part of her sentence. She remained a fugitive
until January 2023, when authorities located her. In February 2023, the
probation office filed violations based on her absconding and other conduct
during her supervised release term. The district court revoked Rico’s
supervised release and sentenced her to 16 months in prison followed by a
new two-year term of supervised release. Rico appealed to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the district court lacked
authority to revoke her supervised release because her original 42-month
term would have expired during the time she was a fugitive, but the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision.
