Anderson v. Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee (No. 25-498)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Must a complaint alleging a fiduciary breach in ERISA underperformance cases
   include allegations of a “meaningful benchmark” to survive the pleading
   stage?

BACKGROUND:
From 2000 to 2015, Winston R. Anderson was a participant in two Intel
Corporation retirement plans: the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan and the Intel
Retirement Contribution Plan. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis,
Intel changed the structure of its proprietary investment funds—used within
these plans—to include allocations to hedge funds and private equity, in
addition to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. According to Intel,
this strategy aimed to reduce volatility and protect against downturns,
though it acknowledged the funds might underperform in bull markets.
Anderson claims that these changes led to persistently poor returns due to
allegedly excessive risk, high fees, and deviation from industry standards.
He also alleges disloyalty by Intel fiduciaries, asserting they invested
plan assets in ways that provided indirect benefits to Intel Capital, a
venture capital arm of the company, rather than prioritizing participants'
financial interests. In 2019, Anderson filed suit in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California, seeking to represent a class of
Intel retirement plan participants whose assets were invested in Intel’s
target-date or global diversified funds since 2009. His complaint alleged
breaches of ERISA’s duties of prudence and loyalty. After multiple amended
pleadings and dismissals, the district court held that Anderson failed to
identify any “meaningful benchmark” against which to measure the imprudence
of the Intel funds’ strategy and failed to plausibly allege a conflict of
interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed,
rejecting Anderson’s underperformance theory and emphasizing that ERISA
requires pleading a plausible inference of flawed investment process—not
merely suboptimal results—and, where appropriate, comparison to suitably
similar investment alternatives.
