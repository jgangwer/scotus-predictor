Abouammo v. United States (No. 25-5146)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Is venue proper in a district where no offense conduct took place, so long
   as the statute’s intent element “contemplates” effects that could occur
   there?

BACKGROUND:
In 2013, Twitter hired Ahmad Abouammo, a U.S. citizen, as a Media
Partnerships Manager responsible for high-profile users in the Middle East
and North Africa. Through this role, he became involved with Bader
Binasaker, a close aide to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Beginning
in 2014, Abouammo used his access to Twitter’s proprietary tools to gather
nonpublic information—including email addresses, phone numbers, and IP
data—about Saudi dissident Twitter users, particularly accounts critical of
the Saudi royal family. He transmitted this information to
Binasaker—circumstantially inferred through encrypted messaging services—and
was rewarded with lavish gifts, including a luxury Hublot watch, and over
$300,000 in wire transfers to a Lebanese bank account held in his father’s
name. Communication between the two included expressions of intent to
“delete evil,” suggesting the sensitive nature of their collaboration. After
leaving Twitter in 2015, Abouammo continued to facilitate communication
between Saudi representatives and Twitter, allegedly under the guise of
social media consulting. In October 2018, FBI agents approached him as part
of an investigation into unauthorized access of Twitter accounts connected
to Saudi espionage. During the interview at his Seattle home, Abouammo
denied wrongdoing and claimed he was paid for legitimate consulting. While
the agents waited in his home, Abouammo fabricated an invoice to
substantiate this claim and emailed it to them. The actions connected to the
allegedly falsified document—including the questioning, fabrication, and
transmission—all took place in Seattle. The agents who received the
document, though physically present in Seattle at the time, worked out of
the FBI field office in San Francisco. A grand jury in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California indicted Abouammo for
falsifying a record with intent to obstruct a federal investigation, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1519, among other charges. Abouammo moved to
dismiss the falsification count for improper venue, arguing that all
relevant conduct occurred in Seattle. The district court denied the motion,
holding venue proper in the Northern District because the statute required
an intent to obstruct an investigation based there. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that venue is proper in a
district where the obstructed investigation occurred, even if none of the
defendant’s physical conduct took place there.
