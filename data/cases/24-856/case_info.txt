Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Doe I (No. 24-856)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does either the Alien Tort Statute or the Torture Victim Protection Act
   allow a judicially-implied private right of action for aiding and
   abetting?

BACKGROUND:
Beginning in the 1990s, the Chinese Communist Party initiated a campaign of
persecution—referred to as “douzheng”—against practitioners of Falun Gong, a
spiritual discipline derived from Buddhism that grew rapidly in popularity
across China. In 1999, the Party formally sought to eliminate Falun Gong
through detention, forced conversion, and torture, designating it an illegal
organization. To support these efforts, the Chinese authorities envisioned a
nationwide surveillance system named the “Golden Shield,” designed to
monitor online activity, identify practitioners, and facilitate their
apprehension. Because China lacked the necessary technological
infrastructure, Chinese officials sought help from Western firms. Cisco
Systems, Inc., a U.S.-based tech company, allegedly responded with
enthusiasm: from its headquarters in San Jose, California, Cisco pursued
contracts, developed Golden Shield software and hardware, and provided
training and support to Chinese security officers. Plaintiffs alleged that
without Cisco’s technology—including advanced databases, real-time
monitoring systems, and network optimization tools—Chinese authorities could
not have effectively tracked, detained, or tortured Falun Gong adherents.
Plaintiffs in this case include thirteen Chinese nationals and one U.S.
citizen, Charles Lee, who claim they were targeted using Cisco’s technology
and then detained, tortured, and subjected to psychological and physical
abuse. Some plaintiffs reported multiple detentions and long-term
surveillance; others described instances of torture facilitated by
personalized information drawn from Golden Shield databases. Several allege
that the abuses led to the deaths of family members. They contend that the
design, development, and optimization of Cisco’s technology—and its tailored
marketing to support Falun Gong persecution—enabled widespread human rights
abuses undertaken by Chinese state and Party officials. The plaintiffs filed
suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in
2011, bringing claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and Torture Victim
Protection Act (TVPA). The district court dismissed all claims, finding them
insufficiently connected to the United States and lacking the necessary
legal support for aiding and abetting liability. The U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, holding that aiding and abetting
liability is actionable under both the ATS and the TVPA and that the
plaintiffs plausibly alleged Cisco’s knowing participation in a domestic
context.
