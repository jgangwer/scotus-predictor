T. M. v. University of Maryland Medical System Corporation (No. 25-197)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Can the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which prevents parties who lose in state
   courts from challenging injuries caused by state-court judgments, be
   triggered by a state-court decision that remains subject to further
   review in state court?

BACKGROUND:
In March 2023, T.M., a woman with a rare medical condition that triggers
psychosis upon consuming gluten, was involuntarily committed to Baltimore
Washington Medical Center after an episode. Her treating psychiatrist sought
and received state approval to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication;
T.M. contested this but was unsuccessful in administrative proceedings.
Independent psychiatrists later stated that T.M. no longer required
inpatient care. To secure her release, T.M. and the hospital negotiated an
oral agreement, which was formalized as a state court consent order. The
order allowed her to leave the hospital on the condition that she comply
with ongoing psychiatric treatment and medications, switch providers, and
drop pending lawsuits. Her parents, J.M. and A.M., were also bound to notify
authorities if she failed to comply. Ten days later, represented by new
counsel, T.M. and her parents filed the present federal lawsuit claiming
that the consent order was unconstitutional and entered under duress. They
challenged the order as violating T.M.’s due process rights and sought
declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating its enforcement. They did not
request damages or challenge the initial commitment decisions. The U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the lawsuit. It held
that T.M.’s claims were barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which
prevents parties who lose in state courts from challenging injuries caused
by state-court judgments, because they amounted to a request for federal
review of a state court judgment. It also dismissed the parents’ claims for
failure to state a constitutional violation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that T.M. was a “state-court loser”
seeking to undo a state judgment still reviewable in Maryland courts.
Nonetheless, it remanded for the district court to modify T.M.’s dismissal
to be without prejudice, due to lack of jurisdiction.
