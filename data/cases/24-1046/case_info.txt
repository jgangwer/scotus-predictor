Wolford v. Lopez (No. 24-1046)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a law that makes it a crime for a licensed concealed carry permit
   holder to bring a handgun onto private property open to the public—such
   as a store or restaurant—unless the property owner gives “express
   authorization” violate the Second Amendment?

BACKGROUND:
In 2023, Hawaii and California enacted new laws, Act 52 and Senate Bill 2,
respectively, that significantly restrict the public carry of firearms. Both
laws prohibit individuals with carry permits from bringing firearms into
numerous specified “sensitive places.” Hawaii’s list includes fifteen
categories, such as bars, restaurants serving alcohol, parks, beaches, and
banks. California’s list is broader, covering more than two dozen types of
property, including hospitals, public transit, playgrounds, libraries,
museums, places of worship, and casinos. Both states also changed the
default rule for private property open to the public, generally banning
firearms unless the property owner expressly permits them. Hawaii allows
owners to consent verbally, in writing, or via a posted sign. California’s
rule is stricter, permitting consent only through the posting of a specific,
state-mandated sign. Plaintiffs in both states include individuals who hold
concealed-carry permits and various gun-rights organizations. They filed
lawsuits alleging that these new restrictions violate their Second Amendment
right to keep and bear arms. Plaintiffs in both actions sued their
respective state attorneys general, and federal district courts issued
preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement of many of the new provisions.
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit consolidated the
cases, affirming the injunctions in part but reversing them in large part.
The Ninth Circuit’s ruling allowed many of the challenged restrictions to
remain in effect but agreed with the district courts that the states could
not, for example, ban firearms in banks or hospitals.
