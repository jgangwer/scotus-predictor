Chiles v. Salazar (No. 24-539)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a Colorado law banning “conversion therapy”—i.e., attempts to “convert”
   someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity—violate the Free Speech
   Clause of the First Amendment?

BACKGROUND:
Kaley Chiles is a licensed professional counselor practicing in Colorado
Springs. She holds a master's degree in clinical mental health and provides
talk therapy, specializing in clients dealing with addiction, trauma,
sexuality, gender dysphoria, and other mental health concerns. Chiles
identifies as a Christian and serves clients who often seek religiously
informed care that aligns with traditional biblical understandings of
sexuality and gender. Prior to the enactment of a 2019 Colorado law banning
conversion therapy for minors, Chiles counseled clients, including minors,
in accordance with their self-identified goals, which sometimes included
diminishing same-sex attractions or aligning gender identity with biological
sex. Since the law’s passage, Chiles has refrained from engaging in
discussions with minors that she believes could be interpreted as conversion
therapy and alleges that this has hampered her ability to provide full
counseling services in line with her and her clients’ religious convictions.
In September 2022, Chiles brought a pre-enforcement lawsuit under 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983 against Colorado officials responsible for enforcing the statute. She
alleged that the ban on conversion therapy for minors violates her rights
under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.
Seeking a preliminary injunction, she asked the district court to block
enforcement of the law against her. The court denied the motion but found
she had standing to proceed. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit affirmed in full, holding that Colorado’s law regulates
professional conduct that incidentally involves speech and survived rational
basis review.
