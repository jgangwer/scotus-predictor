Ellingburg v. United States (No. 24-482)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Is criminal restitution under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA)
   penal for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause?

BACKGROUND:
In December 1995, Holsey Ellingburg, Jr. robbed a bank and was indicted in
April 1996. He was convicted in August 1996 and sentenced to prison, along
with an order to pay over $7,500 in restitution under the Victim and Witness
Protection Act (VWPA). Following his release from prison in June 2022,
having paid only about one-quarter of the original restitution amount, Mr.
Ellingburg filed a motion arguing that enforcement of his restitution order
was unlawful. He claimed that the applicable 20-year payment period under
the VWPA had expired and that applying a longer restitution term and
mandatory interest provision under the later-enacted Mandatory Victim
Restitution Act (MVRA) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The district court
rejected Mr. Ellingburg’s arguments and upheld the restitution order. The
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court’s
decision.
