Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (No. 24-813)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Can an oil company being sued in state court for its World War II-era oil
   production move its case to federal court simply because the oil was
   produced to meet federal government contracts for wartime fuel—even if
   the contract did not specifically direct how to produce the oil?

BACKGROUND:
Beginning in 2013, several Louisiana coastal parishes—including Plaquemines
Parish and Cameron Parish—filed lawsuits in state court against a consortium
of oil and gas companies such as BP America Production Company, Chevron
U.S.A. Inc., Shell Oil Company, and others. The parishes, joined by
Louisiana state agencies and officials, alleged the companies had violated
Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978
(SLCRMA), which requires certain activities within the state’s designated
“coastal zone” to comply with an environmental permitting system.
Specifically, the parishes claimed the companies engaged in oil and gas
exploration, production, and transportation in various “Operational Areas”
along the Louisiana coast without securing the proper permits or by
violating the conditions of the permits they did have. The complaints
further alleged that pre-1980 activities (before SLCRMA’s effective date)
were not “lawfully commenced,” and thus not exempt under the Act’s
grandfather clause. The parishes seek wide-ranging remedies, including
damages and restoration of affected coastal lands. The events at issue span
decades, with the oil companies’ challenged operations beginning prior to
SLCRMA and, in some cases, dating back to World War II. During the war, some
defendant companies operated under federal government contracts to refine
petroleum products for the war effort, and they argue that some of the crude
oil produced in the disputed areas was used to fulfill those contracts. The
parishes' claims, however, focus on whether the companies’ activities in the
coastal zone were environmentally compliant under Louisiana law, regardless
of any federal wartime contracts or regulations. After the initial filing in
state court, the oil companies have tried multiple times to remove these
cases to federal court, invoking various theories of federal jurisdiction,
including the federal officer removal statute, based on their World War II-
era federal contracts. Each time, the district courts ruled against removal
and remanded the cases to state court, concluding that the oil companies did
not meet the statutory requirements. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit has repeatedly affirmed the remand orders, and the companies now
seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court.
