Pitchford v. Cain (No. 24-7351)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Did the Mississippi Supreme Court unreasonably decide—under the standards
   set by federal habeas law—that Terry Pitchford gave up his right to argue
   that the prosecutor’s explanations for striking four Black jurors were
   false or racially biased?

BACKGROUND:
Terry Pitchford was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for
his involvement in the 2004 armed robbery and killing of Reuben Britt, a
store owner in Grenada County, Mississippi. At the time of the crime,
Pitchford was 18 years old. He confessed to participating in the robbery,
although the fatal shot was fired by his accomplice. At Pitchford’s 2006
trial in the Grenada County Circuit Court, the jury was selected from a pool
that included 36 white and five Black potential jurors. The prosecution used
peremptory strikes to remove four of the five Black prospective jurors.
Pitchford’s counsel raised a Batson objection, alleging that the strikes
were racially discriminatory. The trial court found Pitchford had made a
prima facie showing of discrimination and required the prosecution to
provide race-neutral reasons for each strike. The prosecutor cited
explanations such as the venirepersons’ criminal histories, perceived mental
health issues, or similarities to the defendant. The trial judge accepted
those explanations and allowed the strikes, ultimately empaneling a jury
that included only one Black juror. Pitchford’s counsel sought to preserve
Batson-related objections during a bench conference, emphasizing the racial
composition of the jury and the county, but did not conduct a further
comparative analysis or expressly argue that the prosecution’s stated
reasons were pretextual. Pitchford’s conviction and sentence were affirmed
on direct appeal by the Mississippi Supreme Court, which held that any
pretext arguments had been waived for failure to raise them clearly at
trial. A federal district court later granted habeas relief, but the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, ruling the Mississippi
Supreme Court had reasonably applied Batson and its waiver rule. The U.S.
Supreme Court granted certiorari, limited to the question of whether the
Mississippi Supreme Court unreasonably determined, under AEDPA, that
Pitchford waived his right to rebut the prosecution’s race-neutral
justifications for the challenged juror strikes.
