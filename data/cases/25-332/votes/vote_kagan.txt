# PREDICTION: JUSTICE KAGAN'S VOTE IN TRUMP v. SLAUGHTER

## 1. VOTE
**AFFIRM (siding with Slaughter)** — Kagan will vote to uphold the district court's ruling that President Trump's removal of Commissioner Slaughter violated the statute because it was not for "cause," and that the removal protections for FTC Commissioners do not violate the separation of powers.

## 2. CONFIDENCE
**HIGH**

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: Functional Separation of Powers
Kagan will apply the functional balancing test from *Morrison v. Olson* (1988), which she views as the controlling framework for removal cases despite the Government's effort to overrule it. Her core reasoning:

**Textual Hook:** The statute explicitly requires removal "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office" — crystal-clear congressional specification of grounds. Unlike *Seila Law*'s "shall serve" language that required construction, this text affirmatively limits executive discretion.

**Multi-Member Distinction:** Kagan will emphasize that *Seila Law* and *Collins* explicitly preserved *Humphrey's Executor* for multi-member commissions. The five-member FTC with partisan balance and staggered terms represents the paradigm case *Humphrey's* addressed. The Government asks the Court to overrule a 90-year-old precedent on which Congress has repeatedly relied — exactly the kind of destabilizing move Kagan abhors.

**Historical Practice:** From the oral argument (lines 18-28), Kagan pressed the "slippery slope" concern: "If you accept [the] proposition [that all executive power vests in President], it does not seem as though there's a stopping point." She emphasized this in *Free Enterprise Fund* (dissenting from double-layer invalidation but accepting single-layer) and will view the Government's position as threatening civil service protections, inferior officers, and Article I courts.

**Stare Decisis:** Kagan is exceptionally protective of precedent in statutory cases. She joined Barrett's majority in *Allen v. Milligan* (2023) reaffirming Section 2 of the VRA against originalist challenge, and authored *Kimble v. Marvel* (2015) refusing to overrule patent exhaustion precedent despite policy doubts. *Humphrey's* has governed agency structure for nine decades and 40+ agencies — overruling would be massively disruptive.

### Why Not the Government's Position?

**Pure Vesting Clause Theory Rejected:** Kagan does not subscribe to formalist separation of powers. Her concurrence in *NLRB v. Noel Canning* (2014) accepted recess appointments that Justice Scalia's originalism rejected. She will reject the Government's claim that Article II, § 1, cl. 1 vests "*all* executive power" such that no officer wielding executive power can have removal protection.

**Congressional Structuring Authority:** Kagan believes Congress has broad Necessary and Proper Clause authority to structure agencies, particularly under its Article I legislative powers. She joined Breyer's dissent in *Seila Law* emphasizing Congress's "flexibility" in designing administrative agencies.

**Remedy:** Even if there were constitutional concerns, Kagan will find severance appropriate — striking the removal protection rather than invalidating the FTC's existence or all its past actions.

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### Oral Argument
The transcript excerpts show Kagan's deep concern about **consequences** (line 18-28): "Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way." This echoes her *Sebelius* dissent warning about destabilizing precedent.

When pressed on Article I courts, the Government couldn't provide limiting principles. Kagan will view this as confirming the Government's theory is unworkable.

### Voting Pattern Data
- **95% agreement with Sotomayor** (who will definitely vote for Slaughter)
- **79% agreement with Roberts** (who likely provides the fifth vote for a narrow majority)
- In separation-of-powers cases, Kagan sides with functional balancing: dissented in *Seila Law* (2020), joined the majority in *Lucia v. SEC* (2018) on Appointments Clause but on narrower grounds than Gorsuch's opinion

### Relevant Prior Opinions
- **Dissent in *Seila Law*** (joined Breyer): Multi-member agencies with partisan balance differ from single-director CFPB; *Humphrey's* should control
- **Concurrence in *Free Enterprise Fund*** (joined Breyer dissent): Would have upheld even double-layer protection, but accepted Court's narrower rule
- ***Biden v. Nebraska* (2023) dissent**: Rejected major questions doctrine expansion; emphasized stare decisis and congressional intent

### SCDB Data Pattern
In **Federalism/JudPwr** cases (relevant category), Kagan votes:
- Liberal direction: 66% overall
- But in separation-of-powers specifically, she's more moderate when institutional competence is at issue
- In administrative law cases since 2022: sided with agencies in *Loper Bright* dissent, *SEC v. Jarkesy* dissent, *West Virginia v. EPA* dissent

## 5. COALITION

### Most Likely Configuration
**Kagan joins a Roberts plurality/majority** with Sotomayor, Jackson, and (likely) Kavanaugh.

**Roberts likely authors** a narrow opinion:
1. Preserving *Humphrey's* for multi-member agencies
2. Distinguishing *Seila Law* on single-director structure
3. Avoiding broader constitutional questions about inferior officers, civil service, Article I courts
4. Possibly incorporating some limiting language about "significant executive power" to cabin *Humphrey's* scope

**Kagan will not write separately** unless Roberts's opinion:
- Contains dicta questioning *Humphrey's* long-term viability
- Adopts significant portions of Thomas's or Alito's concurrences from *Seila Law*
- Fails to clearly preserve multi-member protections going forward

If Roberts goes too far toward the Government, Kagan might author a **Sotomayor/Jackson/Kagan plurality** with Kavanaugh concurring in judgment only.

### Who Dissents?
- **Thomas writes principal dissent** (joined by Gorsuch, Alito, possibly Barrett)
- Argues *Humphrey's* was wrongly decided, all principal officers must be removable at will
- Barrett is the swing: might join Roberts's narrow approach or might join Thomas based on originalist methodology

## 6. WILDCARD FACTORS

### Recusal Risk
**ZERO.** No financial interests, no prior involvement, no appearance of bias.

### Unusual Cross-Ideological Alignment Risk
**LOW BUT NONZERO.** The one scenario where Kagan votes to reverse:

**Severance/Remedy Play:** If the Court construes the statute to avoid constitutional questions by reading "for cause" protection very narrowly (essentially giving the President discretion to define "inefficiency" broadly), Kagan might join a unanimous opinion that reverses the district court's *remedy* (reinstating Slaughter) while preserving the statute. This would be consistent with her statutory avoidance instincts.

But this is unlikely because: (1) the statute's language is clear, (2) avoidance only works with genuine ambiguity, (3) this would effectively gut the statute.

### Why Prediction Could Be Wrong

1. **Roberts's Opinion Is Too Broad:** If Roberts writes an opinion that significantly narrows *Humphrey's* (e.g., limiting it to agencies with "non-executive" functions or requiring case-by-case balancing), Kagan might dissent arguing *Humphrey's* should be reaffirmed clearly.

2. **The Government Concedes Too Much:** If the Government during merits briefing concedes that multi-member commissions can have removal protection but argues the FTC's specific powers have grown too extensive, Kagan might accept a fact-intensive approach that sends the case back for further proceedings.

3. **Barrett Provides the Fifth Vote for Narrow Reversal:** If Barrett joins Thomas/Alito/Gorsuch but Roberts writes a concurrence preserving future protection for genuinely "quasi-legislative" agencies (essentially overruling as applied to modern FTC), Kagan might be in dissent with Sotomayor
