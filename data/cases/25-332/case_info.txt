Trump v. Slaughter (No. 25-332)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Do the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade
   Commission violate the separation of powers?

BACKGROUND:
Rebecca Kelly Slaughter was serving as a Commissioner on the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), an agency led by five commissioners appointed by the
President and confirmed by the Senate to seven-year terms. The Federal Trade
Commission Act limits the President’s ability to remove an FTC Commissioner
to “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” President
Donald J. Trump fired Commissioner Slaughter, explaining her continued
service was “inconsistent with [the] Administration’s priorities,” which did
not meet the statutory standard of “cause.” Slaughter sued President Trump
and the three remaining FTC Commissioners, arguing her removal was unlawful
because the President failed to offer a statutory cause. The district court
ruled in favor of Commissioner Slaughter, declaring her removal unlawful,
ordering her reinstatement, and issuing a permanent injunction against the
remaining Commissioners and their subordinates, barring them from
interfering with her duties. The government appealed the decision and
requested a stay of the district court's order pending the appeal. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied the government’s motion for a
stay pending appeal and dissolved an administrative stay that had been
previously entered. The Supreme Court granted the stay on September 22,
2025, and also granted certiorari.
