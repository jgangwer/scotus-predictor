# DOCTRINAL ISSUE ANALYSIS: Trump v. Slaughter (No. 25-332)

## 1. CASE SUMMARY

**Parties:** President Donald J. Trump and other federal officials (Petitioners) v. Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, former FTC Commissioner (Respondent)

**Posture:** President Trump removed Commissioner Slaughter from the FTC without statutory cause, citing policy disagreements (particularly over DEI initiatives). The FTC Act limits removal to "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." District court ruled removal unlawful and ordered reinstatement via permanent injunction. D.C. Circuit denied stay. Supreme Court granted stay and certiorari.

**Question Presented:** Do the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers?

**Disposition Below:** District court held removal unlawful, declared Slaughter remains an FTC Commissioner, and issued permanent injunction against remaining Commissioners barring interference with her duties.

## 2. THRESHOLD QUESTIONS

### 2.1 Standing and Remedial Authority

**The Question:** Does a federal court have authority to reinstate a removed executive officer, either through injunction or mandamus, when the officer was allegedly removed in violation of a statutory for-cause removal restriction?

**Competing Positions:**

*Government:* Courts lack equitable authority to reinstate removed officers. Historical equity practice did not include such remedies (citing *In re Sawyer*, 124 U.S. 200 (1888) — "equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers"). The exclusive remedy for title-to-office disputes is quo warranto under D.C. Code § 16-3501 et seq., which Slaughter did not invoke and which does not authorize reinstatement for federal officers. Declaratory relief is also equitable and thus subject to the same historical limits. Mandamus requires a "clear legal duty," which cannot exist when title to office is disputed and must first be resolved through quo warranto.

*Slaughter:* The President violated a clear statutory mandate. Courts have inherent authority to remedy ultra vires executive action. Modern equity is not limited to 18th-century English chancery practice. Declaratory relief is appropriate. Mandamus is proper when the legal duty is clear (the President removed her without statutory cause). Back pay alone cannot deter a President determined to flout statutory removal restrictions.

**Available Frameworks:**
- Historical equity limitations (*Grupo Mexicano*, *Bessent v. Dellinger*)
- Ultra vires doctrine and equitable causes of action (*Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center*)
- Quo warranto as exclusive remedy (D.C. Code § 16-3501 et seq.)
- Adequacy of legal remedies (Tucker Act claims for back pay)
- Mandamus standards (*Heckler v. Ringer* — requires "clear legal duty")

**Key Precedents:**
- *In re Sawyer*, 124 U.S. 200 (1888): equity courts lack jurisdiction over removal of public officers
- *Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund*, 527 U.S. 308 (1999): federal equity limited to remedies available in English chancery
- *Bessent v. Dellinger*, 145 S. Ct. 515 (2025): same principle
- *Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center*, 575 U.S. 320 (2015): equitable causes of action foreclosed when statutory scheme exists
- *Trump v. Wilcox*, 145 S. Ct. 1415 (2025): stay granted, noting "Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty"
- *Trump v. Boyle*, 145 S. Ct. 2653 (2025): stay granted in similar removal case

**Oral Argument Signals:**
- Government emphasized historical equity limits and quo warranto as exclusive remedy (multiple references in briefs, though transcript shows limited engagement on this during oral argument)
- Several justices focused primarily on merits rather than remedy questions
- Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kagan pressed on scope/stopping-point concerns rather than remedial authority

**Analysis:** This is potentially dispositive. If the Court holds that reinstatement is unavailable as a remedy (either because equity historically did not provide it, or because quo warranto is the exclusive mechanism), the case could be resolved without reaching the constitutional merits. However, oral argument suggests the Court is primarily focused on the constitutional question.

## 3. MERITS ISSUES

### ISSUE 1: Must Humphrey's Executor Be Overruled?

**The Central Question:** Does *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), which upheld for-cause removal protections for FTC Commissioners, remain good law, or has it been so eroded by subsequent precedent that it must be overruled?

**Textual Hook:** Article II, § 1, cl. 1: "The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." Article II, § 3: The President "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."

**Competing Positions:**

*Government (seeking overruling):*
- **Pure Vesting Clause theory:** ALL executive power vests in the President. Repeated throughout Government's briefs and argument: "the executive Power—all of it—is vested in a President" (*Seila Law*, 591 U.S. at 203). The President must be able to remove any officer wielding executive power to ensure faithful execution of the laws.
- **Humphrey's has been functionally overruled:** *Morrison v. Olson* (1988) repudiated Humphrey's core reasoning (the existence of "quasi-legislative" and "quasi-judicial" powers outside the executive power). *Seila Law* (2020) confined Humphrey's to its facts and rejected its reasoning. The case is now a "decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions."
- **FTC 2025 ≠ FTC 1935:** Modern FTC wields quintessentially executive powers: rulemaking with force of law, civil enforcement actions in federal court, investigative powers, adjudication with monetary penalties. It no longer fits Humphrey's narrow exception for agencies that are "quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial" and "form no part of the executive power."
- **Historical pedigree:** The Decision of 1789, *Myers v. United States* (1926), and unbroken line from *Ex Parte Hennen* (1839) through *Trump v. United States* (2024) establish unrestricted presidential removal power. Humphrey's was "grievously wrong when decided."

*Slaughter (defending Humphrey's):*
- **Multi-member structure matters:** Humphrey's recognized that Congress may insulate multi-member expert bodies balanced along partisan lines. This serves important constitutional values: dispersion of power, deliberation, bipartisan consensus, insulation from day-to-day political pressure.
- **Stare decisis:** Humphrey's is 90 years old. Congress has relied on it in structuring dozens of agencies. The regulatory state has been built on this foundation. Overruling would be massively disruptive to settled expectations and government structure. Precedent should not be overruled absent "special justification" beyond mere wrongness (*Ramos v. Louisiana*).
- **Humphrey's remains controlling:** This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed Humphrey's (in *Wiener*, *Morrison*, *Free Enterprise Fund*, *Seila Law*, *Collins*). *Seila Law* distinguished single-director agencies; it did not overrule Humphrey's for multi-member commissions. The FTC today exercises the same core powers it did in 1935 (FTC Act hasn't fundamentally changed).
- **Not all executive power = removable at will:** Congress has authority under Necessary and Proper Clause to structure agencies. Historical practice (going back to 1887 ICC, Sinking Fund Commission, etc.) shows multi-member independent agencies are constitutional. Article II does not explicitly address removal; the Constitution is ambiguous on this point.

**Available Frameworks:**

**(A) Formalist/Originalist — Pure Vesting Clause Theory:**
- All executive power vests in President
- Removal power inherent in executive power
- No statutory restrictions permissible (except possibly for inferior officers in narrow circumstances)
- Historical practice from 1789 Decision of Congress
- Leads to: overrule Humphrey's entirely

**(B) Functionalist — Balancing/Interference Test:**
- From *Morrison v. Olson*: does removal restriction "unduly trammel on executive authority"?
- Consider: whether officer wields significant executive power, whether removal restriction significantly interferes with President's constitutional duties
- Leads to: possibly preserve Humphrey's for multi-member agencies where multiple commissioners dilute individual power

**(C) Categorical Approach — Multi-Member Exception:**
- *Seila Law*/*Collins* framework: single-director agencies cannot be insulated; multi-member agencies can be
- Reasoning: multi-member structure provides internal checks, prevents consolidation of power in one person, requires bipartisan balance
- Historical pedigree of multi-member independent commissions (ICC 1887, FTC 1914)
- Leads to: preserve Humphrey's as limited to multi-member agencies

**(D) Major Powers Doctrine:**
- Suggested in some amicus briefs: distinguish based on significance of agency's powers
- Agencies with major economic/regulatory impact cannot be insulated
- Less significant regulatory bodies might be
- Leads to: potentially overrule for FTC (major enforcement powers) but preserve for smaller agencies

**Key Precedents:**

- **Humphrey's Executor v. United States**, 295 U.S. 602 (1935): Upheld for-cause removal protection for FTC Commissioners. Reasoning: FTC exercises "quasi-legislative" and "quasi-judicial" functions, not executive power. "Occupation of an office does not of itself affect the powers of the President or limit his constitutional liberty to remove one who holds office at his pleasure."

- **Myers v. United States**, 272 U.S. 52 (1926): President has unrestricted power to remove executive officers; statute requiring Senate consent for removal unconstitutional. Broad language about presidential removal power, but Court later distinguished as involving a "purely executive officer."

- **Wiener v. United States**, 357 U.S. 349 (1958): Extended Humphrey's to War Claims Commission despite absence of statutory removal restriction. Found implied limitation based on "intrinsic nature" of agency's duties and "the philosophy of Humphrey's Executor."

- **Morrison v. Olson**, 487 U.S. 654 (1988): Upheld for-cause removal of independent counsel. Rejected formalist approach in favor of functional test: does restriction "unduly trammel on executive authority"? Explicitly rejected Humphrey's "quasi-legislative/quasi-judicial" reasoning but upheld removal restriction on different grounds.

- **Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB**, 561 U.S. 477 (2010): Struck down double-layer removal protection (President → SEC → PCAOB). Did NOT question single-layer protection for multi-member agencies. "We do not decide the status of other Government employees, nor do we decide whether 'lesser functionaries subordinate to [the officers covered by the statute]' must be subject to the same sort of control as those officers."

- **Seila Law LLC v. CFPB**, 591 U.S. 197 (2020): Struck down for-cause removal protection for single-director CFPB. Distinguished multi-member agencies: Humphrey's "limited exception" is for "multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power." But also said modern FTC "wields substantial executive power" and Humphrey's characterization "has not withstood the test of time." Key language: confined Humphrey's to "the set of powers the Court considered as the basis for its decision" in 1935.

- **Collins v. Yellen**, 594 U.S. 220 (2021): Struck down for-cause removal of single FHFA director. Reaffirmed Seila Law's single-director vs. multi-member distinction.

- **Trump v. United States**, 603 U.S. 593 (2024): Presidential immunity case. Described President's power over executive branch as "conclusive and preclusive." Government relies heavily on this language for removal power arguments.

**Oral Argument Signals:**

- **Justice Thomas** (lines 5-25): Pressed Government on whether ANY restriction on removal of principal officers is permissible. Government: No. Justice Thomas confirmed: removal power can be "completely arbitrary"? Government: Yes, subject only to political process, not judicial review.

- **Chief Justice Roberts** (lines 11-25, throughout): Concerned about line-drawing problems. Raised Library of Congress (Perlmutter case) as example of agency with mixed functions. Worried about having to parse every agency. Asked about severability—do we sever the agency or sever the power? Not clearly aligned with either side; seeking narrow resolution.

- **Justice Sotomayor** (lines 9-25): Strongly defended Humphrey's. Emphasized: (1) 90-year pedigree and stare decisis concerns, (2) structural reliance—government built on this for over century, (3) historical evidence that founding-era had NO unqualified removal power, (4) slippery slope—where does this logic stop? Pressed Government repeatedly on consequences: Tax Court, Claims Court, Article I courts, civil service, inferior officers, employees. Most skeptical of Government's position.

- **Justice Kagan** (lines 18-28): Echoed slippery slope concerns. "If you accept [the] proposition [that all executive power vests in President], it does not seem as though there's a stopping point." Pressed on Article I courts, inferior officers, employees. "Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way." Very concerned about Government's "pure Vesting Clause" theory.

- **Justice Jackson** (line 28): Aligned with Kagan/Sotomayor. Suggested Congress should have power to structure agencies under Article I. "I sort of thought that we have Article I, which I think you agree gives Congress some authority to set up these agencies, to determine their structure, to create the offices." Emphasized avoiding "difficult line-drawing problems would be to let Congress decide."

- **Justice Kavanaugh** (line 17): Asked specifically about Federal Reserve. Concerned about undermining Fed independence. Government distinguished Fed as "quasi-private uniquely structured entity that follows a distinct historical tradition" (citing Wilcox-Harris stay opinion). Kavanaugh seemed satisfied with this distinction but it reveals concern about scope.

- **Justice Alito** (lines 25-26): Asked how to reserve decision on agencies not before the Court (Tax Court, Claims Court, Court of Appeals for Armed Forces). Seeking narrow resolution. Suggested deciding case without reaching those other agencies. Not clearly signaling view on merits.

- **Justice Barrett**: No substantial questions during argument (appears in transcript but no questions recorded).

- **Justice Gorsuch**: Not mentioned in transcript excerpts (would need full transcript).

**Critical Exchange—The Slippery Slope Problem:**

The most sustained engagement was over consequences of Government's theory:

1. **Multi-member agencies:** Government concedes NLRB, MSPB all "go down" (lines 22-23)
2. **Inferior officers:** Government acknowledges Myers logic extends to inferior officers (line 23)
3. **Employees/Civil Service:** Government tried to avoid but was pressed—civil service protections for millions of federal employees. Government cited exceptions in 5 U.S.C. § 7511(b) but didn't answer whether ALL civil service protections are unconstitutional. (lines 24-25)
4. **Article I courts:** Government refused to concede these are safe, said it depends whether they exercise "executive power" (line 20-21, 27-28)
5. **Federal Reserve:** Government distinguished as sui generis based on Wilcox-Harris, but this seems unprincipled if "all executive power vests in President" (line 17-18)

This suggests **several justices (Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson, likely Roberts) deeply concerned about unintended consequences** and seeking limiting principles Government cannot provide.

### ISSUE 2: If Humphrey's Survives, Does the Modern FTC Fit Within It?

**The Question:** Even if *Humphrey's Executor* is not overruled as a categorical matter, has the FTC's authority expanded so substantially since 1935 that it no longer qualifies for the narrow exception Humphrey's created?

**Textual Hook:** 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq. (Federal Trade Commission Act)—the actual statutory powers of the FTC.

**Competing Positions:**

*Government:*
- FTC 1935 had limited powers—primarily investigation and reporting to Congress
- FTC 2025 has vast executive powers:
  - **Rulemaking:** Issues regulations with force of law (e.g., Non-Compete Clause Rule,
