Trump v. Cook (No. 25A312)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Should the Court stay a district court injunction preventing the President
   from removing a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors "for
   cause" based on pre-appointment conduct without prior notice or a
   hearing?

BACKGROUND:
In 2023, President Joseph Biden nominated Lisa D. Cook for a full 14-year
term on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System after she had
served a short unexpired term beginning in 2022. The Senate confirmed her to
the new term in September 2023. In August 2025, William Pulte, Director of
the Federal Housing Finance Agency, referred allegations against Cook to the
Department of Justice, claiming she had committed mortgage fraud in
2021—before she joined the Board—by misrepresenting her residency to obtain
favorable loan terms. Shortly after the referral was made public, President
Donald Trump accused Cook of untrustworthiness and, on August 25, 2025,
issued a public letter removing her from office. The President’s letter
cited the mortgage allegations as cause for removal but did not offer Cook
any prior notice or opportunity to respond. Cook sued in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia on August 28, 2025, alleging that her
removal violated the Federal Reserve Act’s requirement that Governors may be
removed only “for cause” and that the President’s action also violated her
procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. She sought a
temporary restraining order, which the district court treated as a motion
for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted the preliminary
injunction on September 9, 2025, ordering that Cook’s removal not be
enforced while the litigation proceeds. The court found that Cook was likely
to prevail on her statutory and constitutional claims and that the
government’s asserted harms were outweighed by the public interest in due
process and Federal Reserve independence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s emergency motion for a
stay on September 15, 2025, with Judges Garcia and Childs concurring and
Judge Katsas dissenting. The Trump administration filed an emergency
application for a stay with the Supreme Court, asking the Justices to allow
Cook’s removal to take effect immediately. The Court deferred a ruling on
the stay. Instead of issuing a summary order, the Court kept the injunction
in place—allowing Cook to remain in office—and scheduled the application for
full oral argument.
