Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc. v. Burton (No. 24-808)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(c)(1) impose any time limit to set
   aside a void default judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction?

BACKGROUND:
In November 2014, Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC, a Nashville-based auto-parts
corporation, entered bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the Middle District of Tennessee. In 2015, Vista-Pro—later represented by
its Chapter 7 trustee—filed an adversary proceeding against Coney Island
Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., a New York corporation, to recover about $50,000
in unpaid invoices. Vista-Pro mailed the summons and complaint to Coney
Island’s Brooklyn address addressed only to the corporate entity, not to any
officer, agent, or individual as required for proper service under the rules
governing service on corporations. Coney Island did not respond to the
complaint, leading the bankruptcy court in May 2015 to enter a default
judgment against it. Following reconversion of the case to a Chapter 7
proceeding, the trustee repeatedly attempted to collect the judgment. Coney
Island received notice of the judgment at least as early as April 2016 when
its CEO was sent a demand letter. Years later, after the trustee sought to
enforce the judgment by freezing Coney Island’s bank assets in New York,
Coney Island sought to vacate the default judgment, arguing that it was void
due to improper service and lack of personal jurisdiction. The bankruptcy
court and later the district court denied Coney Island’s motion to vacate
the judgment as untimely. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed, holding that under its precedents interpreting Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 60(c)(1), motions to vacate void judgments must be filed
within a reasonable time.
