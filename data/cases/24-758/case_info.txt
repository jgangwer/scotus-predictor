The GEO Group, Inc. v. Menocal (No. 24-758)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Is an order denying a government contractor’s claim of derivative sovereign
   immunity immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine?

BACKGROUND:
Alejandro Menocal and other immigration detainees brought a class action
lawsuit against The GEO Group, Inc. (GEO), a private company that operates
the Aurora Immigration Processing Center (AIPC) in Colorado under contract
with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). GEO maintained a
mandatory Sanitation Policy requiring all detainees to clean common areas
including walls, floors, bathrooms, and recreation yards. Detainees who
refused these cleaning assignments faced escalating disciplinary actions,
beginning with suspension of television and phone privileges and potentially
resulting in solitary confinement for up to seventy-two hours. Menocal,
detained from June to September 2014, witnessed fellow detainees placed in
isolation for refusing to clean, and multiple detainees testified to being
threatened with or actually placed in solitary confinement for
noncompliance. Additionally, AIPC operated a Voluntary Work Program where
detainees could work up to eight hours daily in various jobs such as food
preparation, barbering, and laundry services for compensation of $1.00 per
day. Menocal filed suit in October 2014, alleging forced labor under the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act for the mandatory cleaning program and
unjust enrichment under Colorado common law for the $1.00 daily wage in the
Voluntary Work Program. The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado
certified two classes in 2017, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit affirmed in 2018. Following discovery, GEO moved for summary
judgment claiming derivative sovereign immunity under Yearsley v. W.A. Ross
Construction Co. The district court denied GEO's motion in October 2022,
finding that ICE neither directed nor required GEO to compel detainee labor
or limit compensation to $1.00 per day. GEO appealed this denial to the
Tenth Circuit, which dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
