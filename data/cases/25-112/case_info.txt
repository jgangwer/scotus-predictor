Chatrie v. United States (No. 25-112)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Did the execution of the geofence warrant violate the Fourth Amendment?

BACKGROUND:
Okello Chatrie was arrested in connection with the armed robbery of a bank
in Richmond, Virginia, where an individual entered the Call Federal Credit
Union, threatened employees and patrons with a handgun, and escaped with
$195,000. The robbery was captured by surveillance footage, which showed the
perpetrator appearing to talk on a cellphone. Lacking viable leads,
Detective Joshua Hylton applied for a “geofence warrant” in June 2019. This
novel form of warrant compelled Google to provide location data for all
devices that had been near the robbery site within a one-hour window around
the time of the crime. The geofence specified a 150-meter radius centered on
the bank, encompassing not only the crime scene but also public streets,
private residences, a hotel, a church, and a restaurant. Google responded
with anonymized location data of devices within the geofence during the
specified time. The government then requested two additional sets of data
from Google: (1) expanded location data from nine of the original nineteen
users, covering movements outside the geofence over a longer timeframe, and
(2) identifying information for three of those users. One account belonged
to Chatrie. Based on this data, law enforcement identified him as the
suspect, arrested him, and charged him in federal court. Chatrie moved to
suppress the location data obtained through the geofence warrant, arguing
that it violated the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia held that the warrant likely violated the
Fourth Amendment but declined to suppress the evidence under the good-faith
exception. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en
banc, affirmed the district court’s denial of the suppression motion. While
the panel sharply disagreed both on whether a Fourth Amendment search had
occurred and whether the warrant was constitutionally valid, all judges
agreed that any defect was ultimately excused under the good-faith
exception.
