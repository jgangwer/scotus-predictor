Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T, Inc. (No. 25-406)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Are provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 that govern the Federal
   Communications Commission’s assessment and enforcement of monetary
   forfeitures consistent with the Seventh Amendment and Article III?

BACKGROUND:
Between 2014 and 2019, AT&amp;T operated a location-based services program
in which it collected and shared its customers’ mobile location data with
third-party service providers such as Life Alert and AAA. To provide this
data, AT&amp;T contracted with “location aggregators,” who in turn resold
the data to service providers. AT&amp;T required those providers to obtain
customer consent for each location request and reviewed their procedures,
but it did not directly verify customer consent before transferring data. In
2018, news reports began revealing that some service providers misused or
failed to adequately protect customers’ location data. In response, AT&amp;T
halted access for those providers, and by March 2019, shuttered the entire
location-data program. Prompted by these reports, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) initiated an investigation and in 2020 issued a Notice of
Apparent Liability (NAL), proposing a $57 million fine for AT&amp;T’s
purported violations of Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 and
corresponding FCC regulations. AT&amp;T challenged the classification of
location data as “customer proprietary network information” (CPNI), asserted
it had acted reasonably, and raised constitutional objections. After
reviewing AT&amp;T’s written response, the FCC rejected its defenses and
issued a forfeiture order. Significantly, the FCC imposed the fine without a
hearing or trial; AT&amp;T’s only opportunity to respond occurred through
written submissions to the agency. AT&amp;T paid the fine and petitioned the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for review. The Fifth Circuit
vacated the forfeiture order, holding that the FCC’s in-house enforcement
process violated AT&amp;T’s rights under Article III and the Seventh
Amendment.
