Olivier v. City of Brandon, Mississippi (No. 24-993)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does Heck v. Humphrey bar Section 1983 claims for purely prospective relief
   when the plaintiff has already been punished under the challenged law,
   and does that bar apply even if the plaintiff lacked access to federal
   habeas relief?

BACKGROUND:
Gabriel Olivier was an evangelical Christian who regularly preached in
public using signs and loudspeakers to convey religious messages. Between
2018 and 2019, he evangelized several times outside the Brandon
Amphitheater, a city-owned venue in Brandon, Mississippi. In 2019, the city
enacted an ordinance requiring protestors during live events to remain in a
designated protest area, restricting use of loudspeakers and prohibiting
non-handheld signs. In May 2021, Olivier returned to the Amphitheater during
a concert to preach and was ordered by the police chief to move to the
protest area. After briefly complying, Olivier returned to a more populated
area, resulting in a citation for violating the ordinance. He pleaded no
contest in municipal court, paid a fine, and did not appeal the conviction.
Olivier then filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Mississippi, seeking damages and an injunction to prevent future
enforcement of the ordinance, arguing it violated his First and Fourteenth
Amendment rights. The district court held that his claims were barred by the
doctrine established in Heck v. Humphrey because success on them would
necessarily imply the invalidity of his still-standing conviction. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, modifying the dismissal to
be with prejudice only until the conditions set by Heck were met.
