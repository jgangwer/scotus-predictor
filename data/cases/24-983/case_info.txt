Havana Docks Corporation v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. (No. 24-983)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Is the legal right to sue under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act tied to the
   confiscated property claim or the hypothetical, unexpired duration of the
   original property interest?

BACKGROUND:
The dispute centers on property in the Port of Havana now known as the
Havana Cruise Port Terminal. In the early 20th century, the Cuban Government
granted a 50-year concession to a predecessor of Havana Docks Corporation
(Havana Docks) to build and operate piers and terminal facilities at the
port. This concession, a usufructuary right, was extended to 99 years in
1920, with a scheduled expiration date in 2004. Havana Docks, a company
organized under the laws of Delaware and determined to be a U.S. national,
acquired the concession in 1928. In 1960, shortly after Fidel Castro came to
power, the Cuban Government confiscated the concession, expropriating Havana
Docks’ property and assets at the Port of Havana without compensation.
Subsequently, Havana Docks filed a claim with the Foreign Claims Settlement
Commission, which certified a loss of over $9 million stemming from the
confiscation. After Title III of the Helms-Burton Act became fully effective
in May 2019, Havana Docks sued several cruise lines, including Royal
Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Ltd., Carnival
Corporation, and MSC Cruises S.A. Co., for “trafficking” in the confiscated
port property when their ships used the Havana Cruise Port Terminal from
2016 to 2019. The district court initially issued judgments totaling over
$100 million against the four cruise lines. On appeal, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s finding that
Havana Docks is a U.S. national under the Helms-Burton Act. However, the
Eleventh Circuit reversed the judgments related to the 2016-2019 conduct,
holding that Havana Docks’ limited property interest, the 99-year
concession, would have expired in 2004, meaning the cruise lines did not
traffic in the confiscated property during that period. The court remanded
the case for further proceedings on Havana Docks’ separate claims against
Carnival for alleged trafficking between 1996 and 2001.
