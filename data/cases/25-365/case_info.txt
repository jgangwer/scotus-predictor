Trump v. Barbara (No. 25-365)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Is a presidential executive order that denies U.S. birthright citizenship to
   children born in the United States because their parents are unlawfully
   present or in the country on temporary visas consistent with the
   Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a)?

BACKGROUND:
On January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order No.
14,160, titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,”
which declared that individuals born in the United States are not U.S.
citizens at birth if their parents lack sufficient legal status.
Specifically, the order directs federal agencies not to recognize
citizenship claims for children born after February 20, 2025, if: (1) the
mother was unlawfully present in the U.S. and the father was neither a U.S.
citizen nor a lawful permanent resident (LPR), or (2) the mother’s presence
in the U.S. was lawful but temporary and the father was not a U.S. citizen
or LPR. The order was issued on the alleged basis that the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Citizenship Clause does not confer birthright citizenship on
such children because they are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the
United States in the constitutional sense. Three families challenged the
order on behalf of themselves and similarly situated individuals. One class
representative is Barbara, a Honduran asylum applicant whose child is due in
October 2025. Another is Susan, a Taiwanese citizen in the country on a
student visa whose daughter was born in April 2025; her child’s passport
application was in progress at the time of the suit. The third is Mark, a
Brazilian applicant for permanent residence whose son was born in March 2025
and initially received a U.S. passport. These families filed suit under
pseudonyms, alleging that the Executive Order unlawfully strips their
children of citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and 8 U.S.C.
§ 1401(a). They seek to preserve access to citizenship-related benefits
including Social Security, SNAP, and Medicaid. The U.S. District Court for
the District of New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction and
provisionally certified a nationwide class of children affected by the
order. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the
merits of their constitutional and statutory claims. That decision was
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and before a
ruling from that court, the Supreme Court granted certiorari before
judgment.
