Rutherford v. United States (No. 24-820)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
May a district court, when evaluating a motion for compassionate release
   under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), consider as an “extraordinary and
   compelling reason” the fact that a defendant is serving a sentence
   substantially longer than what would be imposed today due to the First
   Step Act’s prospective changes to mandatory minimum penalties,
   particularly where the disparity amounts to decades of additional
   imprisonment?

BACKGROUND:
In 2003, twenty-two-year-old Daniel Rutherford committed two armed robberies
at a Pennsylvania chiropractic office within a five-day period. During the
first robbery, he brandished a gun at the chiropractor and stole $390 and a
watch. Four days later, he returned to the same office with an accomplice,
again pulled a gun, and stole $900 in cash and jewelry. A jury convicted
Rutherford of one count of conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, two
counts of Hobbs Act robbery, and two counts of using a firearm during a
crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). The district court sentenced
Rutherford to 125 months for the robbery-related charges plus mandatory
consecutive sentences of 7 years for the first § 924(c) offense and 25 years
for the second, totaling nearly 42.5 years in prison. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed his conviction in 2007, and he did
not appeal his sentence. In 2021, Rutherford filed a motion for
compassionate release, arguing that changes in federal sentencing law would
result in a significantly shorter sentence if he were sentenced today. The
district court denied his motion in 2023, and the Third Circuit affirmed the
lower court’s denial.
