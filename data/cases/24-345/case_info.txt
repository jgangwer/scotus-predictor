FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund, Ltd. (No. 24-345)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does Section 47(b) of the ICA, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-46 (b), create an implied
   private right of action?

BACKGROUND:
Investment funds organized as closed-end mutual funds under Maryland law
adopted “control share provisions” that stripped voting rights from
shareholders who owned 10% or more of a fund’s shares. These provisions were
adopted in response to activist investor Saba Capital, which had been
acquiring large positions in underperforming closed-end funds with the goal
of unlocking shareholder value through various strategies, including
electing new directors and advocating for share buybacks. Saba Capital sued
sixteen closed-end funds in June 2023, seeking rescission of these control
share provisions. Saba argued that the provisions violated Section 18(i) of
the Investment Company Act (ICA), which requires that “every share of stock
shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other
outstanding stock.” Saba brought its lawsuit under Section 47(b) of the ICA,
relying on Second Circuit precedent that recognized an implied private right
of action for parties seeking to rescind contracts that violate the ICA. The
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted summary
judgment in favor of Saba against eleven of the funds (five were dismissed
due to forum selection clauses requiring suit in Maryland). The district
court held that the control share provisions violated the ICA’s equal voting
rights mandate and ordered their rescission. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed this decision in a summary order.
