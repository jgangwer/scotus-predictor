Hamm v. Smith (No. 24-872)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
When a capital defendant has taken multiple IQ tests with varying results,
   how should courts evaluate the cumulative effect of those scores to
   determine whether the defendant has significantly subaverage intellectual
   functioning under Atkins v. Virginia?

BACKGROUND:
Joseph Clifton Smith was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death
in Alabama. Years later, Smith filed a federal habeas corpus petition under
28 U.S.C. § 2254, seeking to overturn his death sentence on grounds that he
is intellectually disabled and therefore cannot be executed under the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments. The central issue in Smith’s case involved
determining whether he met the three-prong test for intellectual disability:
significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, significant deficits in
adaptive behavior, and manifestation of these qualities before age 18.
Smith's IQ testing revealed multiple scores—72, 74, 75, 74, and 78—that fell
within or near the range associated with intellectual disability when
accounting for standard error of measurement. His experts testified that
four of his five scores were consistent with mild intellectual disability,
while the state’s expert, Dr. King, argued that Smith’s multiple scores
placed him in the borderline range just above intellectual disability. After
extensive evidentiary hearings featuring competing expert testimony about
both Smith’s IQ scores and his adaptive functioning deficits, the district
court found Smith intellectually disabled. The U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Alabama granted Smith’s habeas petition and vacated his
death sentence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed
this decision, but the Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the
case, asking the Eleventh Circuit to clarify whether its ruling relied
solely on the lower end of Smith's IQ score range or on a holistic analysis
of all evidence. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit explained that its
reasoning was based on a holistic analysis.
