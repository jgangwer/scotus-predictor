West Virginia v. B.P.J. (No. 24-43)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause prohibit a state from assigning
   students to girls’ and boys’ sports teams based on their biological sex
   as determined at birth?

BACKGROUND:
B.P.J. is a transgender girl who has identified as female since the third
grade. At the onset of puberty, B.P.J. began taking puberty blockers and
estrogen for medical treatment of gender dysphoria, effectively halting male
pubertal development and aligning her physical characteristics with those of
cisgender girls. Since her social transition, B.P.J. has consistently lived
as a girl at school and participated on girls’ athletic teams. In 2021, West
Virginia enacted the “Save Women’s Sports Act,” which requires public school
and collegiate sports teams to be designated based on “biological sex” and
excludes individuals identified as male at birth from participating on
female teams. This law, by its design and effect, prevented B.P.J. from
continuing to compete on her school’s girls’ cross-country and track teams.
Shortly after the Act took effect, B.P.J., through her mother, sued the West
Virginia State Board of Education and other state and county education
officials, as well as the West Virginia Secondary School Activities
Commission. She alleged that excluding her from girls’ sports violated the
Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. The State of West Virginia intervened
to defend the law. Initially, the district court granted B.P.J. a
preliminary injunction, allowing her to participate on girls’ teams pending
litigation. However, at summary judgment, the district court reversed course
and upheld the law, concluding that the classification on the basis of
“biological sex” was substantially related to the important government
interest in ensuring fairness and opportunity in girls’ athletics. The court
granted summary judgment to the defendants and denied B.P.J.’s cross-motion,
holding that the exclusion of B.P.J. from girls’ sports did not violate the
Constitution or Title IX. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. It held that
application of the law to B.P.J. violated Title IX and that factual disputes
precluded summary judgment against her equal protection claim.
