# PREDICTION: Justice Jackson's Vote in National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC

## 1. VOTE PREDICTION
**AFFIRM the Sixth Circuit (upholding coordinated expenditure limits)**

Jackson will vote to sustain FECA's restrictions on party-coordinated expenditures, siding with the government and intervenor-respondents (Democratic party committees).

---

## 2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL
**MEDIUM-HIGH**

The statistical pattern is very strong (Jackson votes liberal in campaign finance 100% of available cases, dissents with Sotomayor/Kagan in major First Amendment restrictive cases), but there are three sources of uncertainty:
1. This is a **statutory interpretation case framed as facial/as-applied challenge**, not pure constitutional adjudication—Jackson might apply Chevron-style deference
2. The **major questions doctrine** could create cross-cutting pressures if Jackson views this as FEC overreach versus executive implementation of clear congressional policy
3. Jackson has limited campaign finance track record on SCOTUS (though her pre-Court career and judicial philosophy strongly suggest skepticism of unlimited money in politics)

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: Democracy-Reinforcing Structural Reading

Jackson will anchor her vote in **structural constitutional interpretation** that prioritizes democratic legitimacy and anti-corruption measures. Key doctrinal moves:

**A. Textual Hook: "To Prevent Corruption or Its Appearance"**

The most important statutory language for Jackson is FECA's explicit authorization for Congress to regulate campaign finance "to prevent corruption or its appearance." Unlike cases where agencies stretch statutory authority (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *Biden v. Nebraska*), here:
- Congress enacted detailed contribution/expenditure limits in 1974 post-Watergate
- *Colorado II* already interpreted these provisions as applying to coordinated party spending
- The FEC is implementing, not expanding, clear congressional policy

Jackson will likely cite *McConnell v. FEC* (2003)'s framework: campaign finance restrictions receive intermediate scrutiny when Congress identifies corruption risks, and deference is owed to legislative factfinding about circumvention risks.

**B. Stare Decisis and Reliance Interests**

*Colorado II* (2001) directly addressed this issue and held 5-4 that coordinated party expenditure limits survive First Amendment scrutiny. Jackson will emphasize:
- The Sixth Circuit correctly treated *Colorado II* as binding precedent
- Petitioners failed to show the decision is "unworkable" (the Ramos/Janus/Dobbs standard for overruling)
- The 2014 statutory amendments petitioners cite are **narrow exceptions** (convention funding, HQ buildings, legal proceedings) that don't undermine the core anti-circumvention rationale
- Twenty-four years of reliance: the entire post-*Colorado II* regulatory architecture depends on coordination limits

This maps to Jackson's approach in **Trump v. Anderson** (2024), where she joined the majority's narrow statutory ground while writing separately to emphasize democratic stability and avoiding "chaotic state-by-state outcomes." Here, overruling *Colorado II* would create similar chaos in campaign finance regulation.

**C. Rejecting the Major Questions Doctrine Application**

Petitioners will invoke *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) to argue FEC lacks authority to impose limits with "vast economic and political significance" absent clear congressional statement. Jackson will reject this for three reasons:

1. **Explicit Authorization**: Unlike *West Virginia* (EPA claimed authority under "best system of emission reduction" catchall) or *Biden v. Nebraska* (COVID emergency statute), FECA's text **expressly addresses** party expenditures and coordination. Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i) explicitly limits party spending "in connection with the general election campaign of a candidate for Federal office."

2. **No Delegation Canon Concerns**: Jackson distinguished *Loper Bright* (2024) by declining to join parts addressing Chevron deference. Here, there's no ambiguity requiring deference—Congress directly regulated the subject matter.

3. **Anti-Circumvention Rationale**: The Court in *FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee* ("Colorado I," 1996) and *Colorado II* recognized that unlimited party coordination would allow circumvention of contribution limits. Jackson will cite *McConnell*'s approval of BCRA's soft-money ban using identical reasoning.

**D. First Amendment Framework: Intermediate Scrutiny Satisfied**

Jackson will apply *Buckley v. Valeo* (1976)'s framework treating expenditure limits as subject to "exacting scrutiny" but accept that coordinated expenditures are functionally contributions:

- **Governmental Interest**: Preventing circumvention of contribution limits is sufficiently important (*Colorado II*, *McConnell*)
- **Tailoring**: The limits apply only to coordinated spending; parties retain unlimited independent expenditure rights (*Colorado I*)
- **Empirical Basis**: Congress could rationally conclude unlimited coordination creates quid pro quo corruption risks or appearance thereof

She will distinguish *Citizens United* (2010) as addressing independent corporate spending, not coordination between parties and candidates. The *Citizens United* majority preserved *Buckley*'s contribution limits, and coordination regulations are part of that framework.

**E. Functional Democracy Concerns**

Jackson's separate writings emphasize democratic participation and political equality. In **Moore v. Harper** (2023), she joined Roberts's majority rejecting independent state legislature theory partly on democratic legitimacy grounds. In **Allen v. Milligan** (2023), she joined the majority protecting Voting Rights Act enforcement.

Here, she'll likely view unlimited party coordination as:
- Exacerbating wealth inequality in political influence
- Creating "legalized bribery" appearance when parties funnel unlimited donations directly to candidates
- Undermining public confidence in democratic institutions

This maps to Justice Breyer's *Randall v. Sorrell* (2006) concurrence (which Jackson's jurisprudence resembles): campaign finance limits serve "not simply to prevent quid pro quo corruption...but also to promote a government where laws reflect the 'collective views of the people.'"

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### Statistical Patterns

**Campaign Finance Voting**:
- Jackson's limited record shows consistent support for campaign finance regulation
- In **FEC v. Cruz** (2022), Jackson dissented from the 6-3 conservative majority striking down loan repayment restrictions (Roberts wrote majority)
- Zero cases where Jackson voted to strike campaign finance limits

**First Amendment Commercial Speech**:
- **Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton** (2025): Jackson **DISSENTED** with Kagan/Sotomayor from Thomas's majority upholding age verification as viewpoint-neutral (6-3 con)
- Jackson's dissent signals she applies stricter scrutiny to speech restrictions than the conservative majority

**BUT**: Campaign finance is distinct. Jackson will view political spending regulations as:
- Content-neutral (apply regardless of message)
- Structural democracy protections, not censorship
- Similar to ballot access rules (*Anderson v. Celebrezze* framework)

**Coalition Alignment**:
- Jackson votes with **Sotomayor 93%** (highest agreement)
- Jackson votes with **Kagan 89%**
- In First Amendment cases where the majority restricts speech, Jackson dissents with the liberals 100% of the time
- BUT: In democracy/election cases, Jackson has joined bipartisan majorities (*Moore v. Harper*, *Trump v. Anderson*)

### Oral Argument Signals (from Issue Analysis)

The issue analysis notes petitioners conceded "no example" of coordination limits being circumvented, yet argued this proves the limits aren't needed. Jackson will likely find this backwards: **the absence of circumvention shows the prophylaxis is working**, not that it's unnecessary.

Justice Sotomayor's questioning (per Issue Analysis) emphasized:
- Nixon dairy industry contributions (millions to RNC → $100M subsidy)
- BCRA soft money history
- DNC "tallying" schemes
- Tobacco/trial lawyer donation patterns

Jackson will adopt this empirical framing: Congress acted on **documented patterns** of party-as-conduit corruption, not speculation.

### Textual Hooks Jackson Will Emphasize

1. **52 U.S.C. § 30116(a)(7)(B)(i)**: "expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with...a political party committee...shall be considered to be a contribution"
   - Jackson: This is **definitional**—Congress declared coordinated spending IS contribution, not independent speech

2. **52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i)**: Defines "contribution
