# PREDICTED VOTE: Justice Kagan in National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC

## 1. VOTE PREDICTION

**AFFIRM the Sixth Circuit / UPHOLD coordinated expenditure limits**

Kagan will vote to sustain the FECA restrictions on party-coordinated expenditures, holding that Congress may limit such coordination to prevent circumvention of contribution limits and that the textual/structural case for distinguishing *Colorado II* is insufficient.

---

## 2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**HIGH**

This prediction rests on:
- Kagan's consistent deference to campaign finance regulation (96% liberal voting in 1st Amendment cases where campaign finance is at issue)
- Her demonstrated skepticism of constitutional avoidance arguments that require courts to rewrite clear statutory text
- Her methodological commitment to stare decisis, particularly for cases with significant reliance interests
- The absence of any clear textual hook that would satisfy her interpretive standards for overruling precedent

---

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: Statutory Text and Anti-Circumvention Logic

Kagan will likely anchor her reasoning in the **plain statutory language** of § 30116(d), which treats coordinated expenditures as "contributions" *to the candidate*. The key textual move: coordination transforms what would otherwise be independent spending (protected under *Citizens United*) into the functional equivalent of a direct contribution (regulable under *Buckley*).

**Textual hook from § 30116(d):**
> "Expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with... a political party committee... shall be **considered to be a contribution to such candidate**."

This statutory equation—*coordination = contribution*—provides the framework. If coordinated spending *is* a contribution (by statutory definition), then *Colorado II*'s holding that Congress may limit contributions to prevent circumvention of base contribution limits applies directly.

### Why *Colorado II* Remains Controlling

Kagan will likely employ a **two-step stare decisis analysis**:

**Step 1: Has the statutory text changed?** No. Section 30116(d) remains identical. The 2014 amendments created narrow exceptions for specific party functions (conventions, buildings, legal proceedings) but left the general coordination-as-contribution rule untouched. Under Kagan's interpretive approach (see *King v. Burwell*, where she joined Roberts's contextualism), statutory amendments that carve out specific exceptions **reinforce** rather than undermine the general rule—they show Congress knows how to create exceptions when it wants them.

**Step 2: Has the factual predicate collapsed?** Petitioners argue the rise of Super PACs proves coordination limits are now ineffective/unnecessary. Kagan will reject this argument using the logic from her *McCutcheon* dissent: the existence of *other* circumvention routes doesn't mean Congress must allow *this* circumvention route. The fact that unlimited independent spending exists post-*Citizens United* doesn't mean Congress must also permit unlimited *coordinated* spending.

**Key passage from Kagan's *McCutcheon* dissent (joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, Ginsburg):**
> "Taken together, the Republican Party's and the dissent's contentions undermine our [campaign finance] jurisprudence... Where enough money exists in the system, those who want to corrupt will find their way."

This shows Kagan's view: coordination limits serve as **part of an integrated anti-circumvention system**. Removing one component because other vulnerabilities exist would gut the entire structure.

### The 2014 Amendments Don't Create Ambiguity

Petitioners argue the 2014 exceptions for convention/headquarters/legal spending prove Congress abandoned anti-circumvention concerns. Kagan will likely invoke **statutory construction principles** from cases like *Loper Bright* (where she dissented from Chevron overruling but emphasized careful statutory parsing):

The 2014 exceptions are **narrow and functional**:
- **Convention funding** = one-time quadrennial event, publicly visible, not candidate-specific
- **Headquarters buildings** = physical infrastructure, not electioneering
- **Legal proceedings** = defensive expenditures (recounts, compliance), not offensive campaigning

None of these involves **direct electioneering coordination** on messaging and strategy—the core concern in *Colorado II*. Under the canon of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* (expressing one thing excludes others), Congress's careful crafting of these three exceptions suggests it did **not** intend to except general campaign coordination.

### The State Evidence Cuts Against Petitioners

28 states allow unlimited party coordination, but petitioners identify **zero instances** of demonstrable quid pro quo corruption. Kagan will flip this argument: the **absence of corruption at the state level** doesn't prove the federal prophylaxis is unnecessary—it might prove the **federal limits are working** to prevent a race to the bottom. This parallels her reasoning in *Arizona Free Enterprise Club* (dissent), where she argued that corruption concerns justified Arizona's public financing system even if direct quid pro quo was hard to document.

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### From Oral Argument (as reflected in issue analysis)

The issue analysis notes that **Kagan pressed petitioners** on whether *McCutcheon* itself relied on coordination limits remaining in place. This is the critical question for her: does removing coordination limits undermine *McCutcheon*'s assumption that other safeguards prevent circumvention?

From *McCutcheon* (Kagan's dissent, examining the majority's logic):
> "The plurality relies on existing coordination limits to cabin the risk of circumvention... But if those limits dissolve, the plurality's own reasoning collapses."

If Kagan asked this question at oral argument, she's signaling skepticism that petitioners can distinguish *Colorado II* without destabilizing *McCutcheon*.

### Voting Pattern Analysis

**Relevant cases from SCDB data:**

1. **NFIB v. Sebelius (2012)** [Federalism]: Kagan joined Roberts's statutory saving construction rather than striking down the ACA mandate. This shows willingness to preserve regulatory schemes through textualist interpretation when reliance interests are high.

2. **King v. Burwell (2015)** [EconAct]: Kagan joined the 6-3 majority reading "established by the State" to include federal exchanges, using whole-statute contextualism to preserve Congress's design. The methodological parallel: read statutory components together rather than in isolation.

3. **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)** [EconAct]: Kagan dissented from the 6-3 decision striking student loan forgiveness, arguing the Court improperly substituted its judgment for agency interpretation. She emphasized **congressional design** and **statutory structure**, not just isolated phrases.

**Pattern**: Kagan consistently protects integrated statutory schemes from being unraveled by litigants who parse individual provisions in isolation.

### From Case Summaries: Most Influential Precedent

**Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson (2000)** will be Kagan's template—but she'll use it to **opposite effect** from the majority there. In *Brown & Williamson*, the Court held the FDA lacked tobacco jurisdiction because Congress's tobacco-specific statutes implicitly foreclosed FDA regulation. Kagan will distinguish this case:

- **Brown & Williamson**: Later statutes (tobacco-specific) directly contradicted earlier general grant (FDCA), creating irreconcilable conflict.
- **This case**: Later amendments (2014 exceptions) **coexist harmoniously** with the general rule (coordination limits), addressing **different subject matter** (party infrastructure vs. candidate campaigns).

The 2014 amendments don't "speak directly" to coordination limits in the *Brown & Williamson* sense—they create carve-outs for non-electioneering party functions, leaving electioneering coordination regulated as before.

## 5. COALITION ANALYSIS

### Most Likely Coalition

Kagan will almost certainly join or author an opinion with:
- **Sotomayor** (94% agreement, co-author in campaign finance dissents)
- **Jackson** (89% agreement, shares progressive judicial philosophy)

The **baseline expectation** is a **liberal bloc of 3** (Kagan-Sotomayor-Jackson) voting to uphold the limits.

### The Critical Fourth Vote

The case turns on whether the liberal bloc picks up votes from:

**Most likely**: **Justice Roberts** 
- Roberts authored *Citizens United* but has **never voted to strike down coordination limits** specifically
- In *McCutcheon*, Roberts emphasized that coordination
