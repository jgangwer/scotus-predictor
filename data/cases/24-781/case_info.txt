First Choice Women's Resource Centers, Inc. v. Platkin (No. 24-781)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
When the recipient of a state investigatory subpoena demonstrates an
   objectively reasonable chill of its First Amendment rights, does a
   federal court lack jurisdiction to hear the case because those
   constitutional claims must first be resolved in state court?

BACKGROUND:
First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, Inc. is a nonprofit organization in
New Jersey that operates a network of centers offering pregnancy-related
services. In 2023, the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs began
investigating First Choice over concerns that its client-facing websites
downplayed its pro-life mission and may have misled donors and clients about
its services, staff qualifications, and medical practices. State
investigators identified possible discrepancies between what First Choice
told donors—emphasizing a pro-life mission—and what was publicly
communicated to potential clients on other websites. The investigation also
scrutinized potentially misleading medical statements and questioned whether
unlicensed staff were performing services that require medical credentials.
As part of its investigation, the State issued a non-self-executing subpoena
to First Choice seeking internal documents, advertising material,
substantiation for medical claims, and information on donors and licensed
personnel. First Choice objected to the subpoena—particularly the requests
for donor identities—arguing that complying would violate its constitutional
rights, including freedom of association and donor privacy. While First
Choice continued to raise these objections, the state filed a motion in New
Jersey Superior Court to compel enforcement. The state court denied First
Choice’s motion to quash the subpoena in full but did not order immediate
production of documents. Instead, it instructed the parties to negotiate the
subpoena’s scope, specifically reserved constitutional arguments for future
resolution, and clarified that donor identities would be sought only for
those who contributed through two specific websites. As a result, First
Choice remained under no court order to turn over the disputed materials
while negotiations continued. While contesting the subpoena in state court,
First Choice filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey, seeking federal relief to block enforcement on constitutional
grounds. The district court twice dismissed the federal suit as unripe, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, holding that the
ongoing state court proceedings and the lack of any order compelling
compliance rendered First Choice’s claims not ready for federal
adjudication.
