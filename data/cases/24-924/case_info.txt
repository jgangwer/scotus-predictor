Hencely v. Fluor Corporation (No. 24-924)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does Boyle v. United Technologies Corporation, which immunized government
   contractors from liability under certain circumstances, extend to preempt
   state tort claims against a government contractor for conduct that
   breached its contract and violated military orders?

BACKGROUND:
In 2016, U.S. Army Specialist Winston Tyler Hencely was stationed at Bagram
Airfield in Afghanistan as part of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. Fluor
Corporation held a Department of Defense contract to provide base life
support services at Bagram, including vehicle maintenance and hazardous
materials management. Under the military’s “Afghan First” counterinsurgency
program, which aimed to develop the Afghan economy by employing local
nationals, Fluor’s subcontractor hired Ahmad Nayeb, an Afghan national. The
Army sponsored Nayeb’s employment despite knowing he was a former Taliban
member, viewing his hiring as a reintegration effort. Nayeb worked the night
shift at the hazardous materials section of the non-tactical vehicle yard
with limited supervision. During his employment, Nayeb likely smuggled
explosives onto the base and constructed an explosive vest while working
alone, using base tools including a multimeter he had checked out despite
not needing it for his assigned duties. On the morning of November 12, 2016,
at the end of his shift, Nayeb was supposed to board a bus to be escorted
off base. Instead, he lied about needing to attend a hazardous materials
class and walked undetected for 53 minutes to an area near the starting line
of a Veterans Day 5K race. When Hencely and others confronted him, Nayeb
detonated his vest, killing himself and five others while severely wounding
seventeen more, including Hencely. The Taliban claimed credit for the
attack. Hencely sued Fluor in the U.S. District Court for the District of
South Carolina, alleging negligent supervision, entrustment, and retention
under South Carolina law, as well as breach of the government contract. The
district court granted judgment to Fluor on all claims, holding that federal
law preempted the state tort claims and that Hencely was not a third-party
beneficiary entitled to enforce the government contract. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.
