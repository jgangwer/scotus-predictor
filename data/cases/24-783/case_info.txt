Enbridge Energy, LP v. Nessel (No. 24-783)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Do district courts have the authority to excuse the thirty-day procedural
   time limit for removal in 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(1)?

BACKGROUND:
Enbridge Energy, LP, owns and operates Line 5, an oil pipeline that
transports petroleum products through Wisconsin and Michigan before
terminating in Ontario, Canada. Since 1953, Line 5 has run across the
bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac under an easement granted by the
State of Michigan, which owns the submerged lands. In recent years, concerns
over Line 5’s safety and environmental impact led to increased scrutiny and
legal challenges regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, including
questions about Michigan’s regulatory authority and the potential preemption
of state law by federal pipeline laws and international treaties. On June
27, 2019, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit in Michigan
state court, seeking to enjoin Enbridge from operating Line 5 in the
Straits. The Attorney General alleged violations of the public-trust
doctrine, common-law public nuisance, and the Michigan Environmental
Protection Act. Both parties filed dispositive motions, with Enbridge
asserting, in part, that federal law preempted Michigan’s claims. Separate
but closely related litigation followed when Governor Gretchen Whitmer
issued an easement-revocation notice in November 2020 and filed her own
state-court suit against Enbridge. After engaging in nearly two years of
state-court proceedings in the Attorney General’s case, Enbridge removed the
case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in
December 2021, arguing federal-question jurisdiction. The district court
rejected the Attorney General’s motion to remand, holding that removal was
proper either under statutory timing rules or equitable exceptions. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding Enbridge’s removal
was untimely and that statutory deadlines for removal are mandatory and
immune to equitable exceptions, and ordered the case remanded to Michigan
state court.
