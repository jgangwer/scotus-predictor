United States v. Hemani (No. 24-1234)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a federal law that prohibits the possession of firearms by a person who
   “is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance” violate
   the respondent’s Second Amendment right to bear arms?

BACKGROUND:
A grand jury indicted Ali Danial Hemani in February 2023 for violating 18
U.S.C. § 922(g)(3), a federal law prohibiting firearm possession by an
“unlawful user of…a controlled substance.” The indictment alleged that in
August 2022, Hemani knowingly possessed a Glock 19 9mm pistol while being an
unlawful user of controlled substances. The government specified that Hemani
allegedly used marijuana, promethazine, and cocaine. The pistol was located
in the closet of Hemani’s parents’ home. Crucially, the prosecution did not
allege that Hemani was intoxicated or using a controlled substance at the
precise time he possessed the firearm. The government’s case rested on his
status as a regular drug user, not on simultaneous use and possession.
Hemani filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing the law was
unconstitutional as applied to him. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas granted the motion and dismissed the indictment. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, concluding
that a binding regional precedent (United States v. Connelly) rendered the
law’s application to Hemani unconstitutional.
