Monsanto Company v. Durnell (No. 24-1068)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act preempt a
   label-based failure-to-warn claim where EPA has not required the warning?

BACKGROUND:
John L. Durnell used Monsanto’s product Roundup, a herbicide containing the
active ingredient glyphosate. Durnell subsequently developed non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, which he alleged was caused by his exposure to Roundup and
glyphosate. In January 2019, Durnell sued Monsanto, asserting claims for
strict liability defective design, strict liability failure to warn, and
negligence. Durnell claimed that Monsanto should have included a cancer
warning on Roundup’s label to alert users to the risk of developing non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma from glyphosate exposure. After a jury trial in September
2023 in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, the jury found in favor
of Durnell on his strict liability failure to warn claim and awarded him
$1.25 million in compensatory damages, but ruled for Monsanto on the
defective design and negligence claims. Monsanto moved for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that federal law—specifically the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)—both expressly
and impliedly preempted Durnell’s failure to warn claim. The trial court
denied the motion, and Monsanto appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals,
Eastern District, which affirmed the judgment.
