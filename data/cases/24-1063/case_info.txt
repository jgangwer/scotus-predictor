Hunter v. United States (No. 24-1063)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
1. Does an appeal waiver bar all claims except for ineffective assistance of
   counsel or a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum?  2. Does such a
   waiver become ineffective if the sentencing judge later tells the
   defendant they can appeal, and the government fails to object?

BACKGROUND:
Munson P. Hunter, III pleaded guilty to committing wire fraud affecting a
financial institution and to aiding and abetting. A federal district court
sentenced him to 51 months in prison followed by three years of supervised
release. A specific condition of that supervised release requires Hunter to
take any mental health medication prescribed by his physician. Hunter
challenged his sentence at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
arguing the medication condition infringed on his due process liberty
interests and that the written judgment improperly included the “aiding and
abetting” reference. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal regarding the
medication condition, finding it was barred by an appeal waiver in Hunter's
plea agreement, and affirmed the judgment, noting that the “aiding and
abetting” charge was indeed part of the count to which Hunter pleaded
guilty.
