Watson v. Republican National Committee (No. 24-1260)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Do the federal election-day statutes preempt a state law that allows ballots
   that are cast by federal election day to be received by election
   officials after that day?

BACKGROUND:
Federal statutes designate the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as
the uniform day for electing members of Congress and appointing presidential
electors. While Mississippi requires voters to cast absentee ballots by this
federal deadline, the state legislature amended its election code in 2020 to
permit the counting of mail-in ballots received up to five business days
after Election Day, provided they are postmarked by that Tuesday. This
“postmark rule” allows validly cast votes delayed by mail service to be
included in the final tally, a practice currently utilized by approximately
thirty states. In 2024, the Republican National Committee, the Mississippi
Republican Party, the Libertarian Party of Mississippi, and individual
voters filed suit against Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson and
county election officials. The plaintiffs argued that the federal statutes
establishing a singular “election” day preempt Mississippi’s five-day
receipt window, contending that an election is not legally concluded until
officials actually receive the ballots. They sought to invalidate the state
statute and enjoin officials from counting any absentee ballots received
after federal Election Day. The district court granted summary judgment in
favor of the state officials, ruling that the state law did not conflict
with federal statutes. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
reversed, holding that federal law preempts the Mississippi statute because
ballots must be both cast and received by Election Day.
