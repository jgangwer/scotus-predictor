Flower Foods, Inc. v. Brock  (No. 24-935)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Are workers who deliver locally goods that travel in interstate commerce—but
   who do not transport the goods across borders nor interact with vehicles
   that cross borders—“transportation workers” “engaged in foreign or
   interstate commerce” for purposes of the exemption in Section 1 of the
   Federal Arbitration Act?

BACKGROUND:
Petitioners—the defendants, collectively known as “Flowers”—produce and sell
packaged baked goods throughout the United States. Flowers utilizes a
“direct-store-delivery” system, contracting with individuals it classifies
as independent distributors who purchase the rights to distribute its
products within specific geographic territories. In 2016, Angelo Brock,
operating as Brock, Inc., signed a “Distributor Agreement” with Flowers
Baking Co. of Denver, LLC (“Flowers Denver”) to distribute products in parts
of Colorado. This agreement, along with a “Personal Guaranty” Brock signed,
included a mandatory Arbitration Agreement stipulating that disputes must be
resolved under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Under this arrangement,
Brock, Inc. placed orders for products, most of which were produced by
Flowers bakeries located out of state, specifically to fill those orders.
Flowers shipped the goods to a warehouse in Denver. Brock picked up the
products at the warehouse, loaded them onto his own vehicle, and delivered
them to his customers—various retail stores located only within Colorado.
Brock himself did not cross state lines while making these deliveries. The
business relationship soured, and Brock filed a lawsuit alleging Flowers
misclassified its distributors as independent contractors to systematically
underpay them, asserting violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and
Colorado labor law. Brock filed his putative class and collective action in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Flowers moved to
compel arbitration based on the parties’ agreement, but the district court
denied the motion, concluding that Brock falls within the FAA’s § 1
exemption for transportation workers engaged in interstate commerce. On
appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed that
decision.
