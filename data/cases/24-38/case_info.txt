Little v. Hecox (No. 24-38)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
May a state, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
   Amendment, categorically require sports participants to compete based on
   their biological sex, rather than gender identity?

BACKGROUND:
In 2020, Idaho enacted the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which
categorically barred transgender girls and women from participating on
female athletic teams in public schools—from elementary school through
college. Prior to the law’s passage, Idaho’s high school athletic
association and the NCAA allowed transgender women to compete on women’s
teams after a year of hormone therapy. At the time, there were no known
instances of transgender girls competing in Idaho athletics under those
existing rules. Nonetheless, Idaho lawmakers passed the Act, citing concerns
about “fairness” and biological differences attributed to testosterone and
other factors. The law allowed any individual to challenge a female
athlete’s gender, triggering a mandatory medical verification process that
could include analysis of reproductive anatomy, genetic make-up, or
testosterone levels. Cisgender women, including those perceived as more
masculine, could also be subjected to these checks. Lindsay Hecox, a
transgender woman and student at Boise State University who wished to join
the women’s cross-country team, filed suit alongside a cisgender high school
athlete known as Jane Doe. They alleged that the Act violated their
constitutional rights, including the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Hecox had undergone hormone therapy, significantly
lowering her testosterone levels, but was still categorically excluded under
the law. The district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the
law in August 2020, finding it likely unconstitutional. After several rounds
of appeal and remand, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
ultimately affirmed the injunction as applied to Hecox but remanded the case
to the district court to reconsider the scope of the injunction, especially
in light of the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Labrador v. Poe.
