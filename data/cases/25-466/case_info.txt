Sripetch v. SEC (No. 25-466)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
May the SEC seek equitable disgorgement under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(5) and
   (d)(7) without showing investors suffered pecuniary harm?

BACKGROUND:
From at least 2013 to 2019, Ongkaruck Sripetch participated in a series of
fraudulent securities schemes involving at least 20 microcap, or “penny,”
stock companies. Working alongside various associates and through multiple
entities, Sripetch acquired discounted shares of small-cap companies and
then secretly funded promotional campaigns to inflate their stock prices
before selling his own holdings into the artificially heightened market—a
practice known as stock scalping. He also engaged in unregistered sales of
securities, most notably through control of a company called Abby Inc., and
manipulated trading in another company, VMS Rehab Systems, through matched
trades and wash trades designed to create the illusion of market activity.
Later, he organized pump-and-dump schemes for Argus Worldwide stock, using
matched trading to build trading volume before dumping shares after
promotions without disclosing his intent to sell. In 2020, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil enforcement action
against Sripetch and others. In 2023, Sripetch consented to a bifurcated
judgment, agreeing to the SEC’s allegations for the purposes of remedies.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California found him
liable for $2.25 million in disgorgement and over $1 million in interest. On
appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed that the
SEC may obtain disgorgement under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(5) and (d)(7) without
showing that investors suffered pecuniary harm, joining a circuit split on
this question.
