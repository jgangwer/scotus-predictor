Montgomery v. Caribe Transport II, LLC (No. 24-1238)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c) preempt a state common-law claim against a broker
   for negligently selecting a motor carrier or driver?

BACKGROUND:
Shawn Montgomery was severely injured when his tractor-trailer, stopped on
the shoulder of an Illinois highway, was struck by another truck. The other
driver, Yosniel Varela-Mojena, was employed by the motor carrier Caribe
Transport II, LLC (“Caribe”). C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“Robinson”), a
freight broker, had arranged for Caribe to haul the shipment. Robinson and
Caribe operated under an agreement stating that Caribe was an independent
contractor and retained exclusive control over its personnel and the manner
of its performance. Montgomery sued the driver and Caribe, and also sued the
broker, Robinson. His claims against Robinson alleged that the broker was
vicariously liable for the driver’s negligence, arguing Caribe was
Robinson’s agent. Montgomery also claimed Robinson had negligently hired the
driver and the carrier. The district court granted judgment to Robinson on
all claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed,
holding that Caribe was an independent contractor, which defeated the
vicarious liability claim, and that the Federal Aviation Administration
Authorization Act preempted the state-law negligent hiring claim.
