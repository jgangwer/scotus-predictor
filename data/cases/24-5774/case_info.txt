Barrett v. United States (No. 24-5774)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
May a defendant who commits a single act that violates two statutory
   provisions be convicted under both provisions?

BACKGROUND:
Between August 2011 and January 2012, Dwayne Barrett and several co-
conspirators carried out a string of armed robberies in New York, often
using guns, knives, and threats of violence. On December 12, 2011, Barrett
and two associates followed a minivan carrying the proceeds from a sale of
untaxed cigarettes. While Barrett waited in the car, his accomplices held
two men at gunpoint and stole the vehicle, which also contained $10,000 and
a third victim, Gamar Dafalla. As he tried to discard some of the money
during the getaway, Dafalla was fatally shot by one of the robbers. Later
that day, Barrett took part in another robbery, threatening a victim’s life.
He also helped dispose of the murder weapon and clean their vehicle with
latex gloves and cleaning fluid to eliminate evidence. Barrett was indicted
on multiple counts, including conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, two
substantive counts of Hobbs Act robbery (one involving Dafalla’s murder),
and separate firearms offenses, including a murder charge under 18 U.S.C. §
924(j). He was convicted in 2014 and originally sentenced to 90 years in
prison. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated
one firearms conviction under the Supreme Court’s then-new decision in
United States v. Davis. Barrett was resentenced to 50 years in 2021. After
further appellate proceedings, the Second Circuit affirmed most of his
convictions and sentence but vacated and remanded for resentencing in light
of the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Lora v. United States, which held
that § 924(j) does not require consecutive sentencing under § 924(c).
