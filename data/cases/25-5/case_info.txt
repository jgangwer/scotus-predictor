Noem v. Al Otro Lado (No. 25-5)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a noncitizen who is stopped on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico
   border “arrive[] in the United States” within the meaning of Immigration
   and Nationality Act?

BACKGROUND:
Beginning in 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) implemented a
“metering” policy at ports of entry along the United States-Mexico border to
manage asserted capacity constraints. CBP officers stationed at the physical
boundary line turned away asylum seekers lacking valid travel documents,
preventing them from stepping onto U.S. soil to undergo mandatory inspection
and processing. These officials instructed migrants to return to Mexico and
wait for future processing opportunities, often without providing specific
appointment times, forcing numerous asylum seekers to endure prolonged
delays in Mexican border towns where they faced significant safety risks.
While these asylum seekers waited, the federal government promulgated the
“Asylum Transit Rule” in 2019, which generally rendered noncitizens
ineligible for asylum if they traveled through a third country without first
seeking protection there. This regulatory change prejudiced individuals
previously turned away under the metering policy because, had CBP processed
them upon their initial arrival, the Transit Rule would not have applied to
their claims. Al Otro Lado, a legal aid organization, joined thirteen
individual asylum seekers to file a class-action lawsuit challenging the
metering policy and seeking to prevent the government from applying the
Transit Rule to those who attempted to enter before its enactment. The U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of California declared the metering
policy unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act and permanently
enjoined the government from applying the Asylum Transit Rule to class
members . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
district court’s conclusion that the policy unlawfully withheld mandatory
agency action, but narrowed the injunction to prevent the district court
from forcing the government to unilaterally reopen past asylum denials.
