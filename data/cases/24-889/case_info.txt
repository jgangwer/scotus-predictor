Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. Amarin Pharma, Inc. (No. 24-889)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
1. When a generic drug manufacturer excludes a patented use from its label,
   can it still be liable for inducing infringement if it calls its product
   a “generic version” of the brand-name drug and cites publicly available
   information about the brand-name drug’s sales? 2. Can a patent
   infringement complaint survive dismissal if it does not allege that the
   defendant made any statement specifically instructing or encouraging the
   patented use?

BACKGROUND:
Amarin Pharma markets icosapent ethyl under the brand name Vascepa. In 2012,
the FDA approved Vascepa for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia (the SH
indication), which affects patients with blood triglyceride levels of at
least 500 mg/dL. In 2019, following additional research and clinical trials,
the FDA approved Vascepa for a second use: reducing cardiovascular risk in
patients with triglyceride levels of at least 150 mg/dL (the CV indication).
Amarin listed two patents covering the CV indication in the FDA’s Orange
Book. In 2016, Hikma Pharmaceuticals submitted an Abbreviated New Drug
Application seeking approval for a generic version of icosapent ethyl. When
the CV indication was approved in 2019, Hikma filed a “section viii
statement” seeking FDA approval only for the SH indication by “carving out”
the patented CV indication from its label—creating a “skinny label.” The FDA
approved Hikma’s ANDA in May 2020. Throughout 2020, Hikma issued press
releases referring to its product as the “generic version” or “generic
equivalent” of Vascepa, describing Vascepa as indicated “in part” for the SH
indication, and citing Vascepa sales figures (over $1 billion annually) that
were attributable primarily to the CV indication. Hikma also marketed its
product on its website under the therapeutic category “Hypertriglyceridemia”
and as “AB” rated, though with a disclaimer that it was approved for fewer
indications than Vascepa. In November 2020, Amarin sued Hikma for induced
infringement of its CV indication patents. The U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware granted Hikma’s motion to dismiss. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, finding that Amarin’s
allegations—based on Hikma’s skinny label combined with its press releases
and marketing materials—plausibly stated a claim for induced infringement.
