Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections (No. 23-1197)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
May an individual sue a government official in his individual capacity for
   damages for violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
   Persons Act (RLUIPA)?

BACKGROUND:
Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, vowed as part of his faith never to cut
his hair—a religious commitment known as the Nazarite Vow. Incarcerated in
2020, Landor was first held at the St. Tammany Parish Detention Center and
later at LaSalle Correctional Center, both of which allowed him to maintain
his hairstyle in accordance with his religious beliefs. After approximately
five months and with three weeks left in his sentence, Landor was
transferred to Raymond Laborde Correctional Center. Upon arrival, Landor
proactively explained his religious practices and presented documentation of
previous accommodations, including a copy of a federal court decision
supporting similar claims. An intake guard disregarded his documentation,
summoned the warden, and upon Landor’s inability to produce immediate
additional proof of his beliefs, guards forcibly handcuffed Landor and
shaved his head. Following his release, Landor sued the Louisiana Department
of Corrections and Public Safety, its Secretary James LeBlanc, the
correctional center, and Warden Marcus Myers, asserting claims under the
Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) and 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983 for violations of his federal constitutional rights, as well as state
law claims. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana
dismissed Landor’s individual-capacity RLUIPA claims for money damages,
holding such relief unavailable under controlling Fifth Circuit precedent.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its
prior decision in Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Texas, and rejecting
Landor’s arguments that subsequent Supreme Court authority or other legal
developments altered that result.
