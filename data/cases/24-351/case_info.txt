United States Postal Service v. Konan (No. 24-351)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does a claim that Postal Service employees intentionally refused to deliver
   mail to a designated address arise out of “the loss” or “miscarriage” of
   postal matter under the Federal Tort Claims Act’s postal-matter
   exception?

BACKGROUND:
Lebene Konan, a Black property owner, leased two rental residences in
Euless, Texas, and retrieved business and tenant mail from a central mailbox
daily. In May 2020, United States Postal Service (USPS) employee Jason Rojas
changed the lock on the mailbox at one of Konan's properties without her
approval, halted mail delivery, and demanded ownership verification. Even
after USPS’s Inspector General confirmed Konan’s ownership, Rojas and
another USPS employee, Raymond Drake, allegedly continued marking mail
addressed to Konan and her tenants as undeliverable. Konan claims this
refusal of service extended to her second property and was racially
motivated, causing loss of rental income and disruption of essential
communications. Konan sued USPS, Rojas, Drake, and the United States,
raising claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and alleging
violations of the equal protection guarantees of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1985.
The district court dismissed her FTCA claims for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction under the postal-matter exception, and her equal protection
claims for failure to state a claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the equal protection claims but reversed
on the FTCA claim, holding that sovereign immunity did not bar claims based
on intentional acts of mail non-delivery.
