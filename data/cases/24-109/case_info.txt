Louisiana v. Callais (No. 24-109)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does Louisiana’s creation of a second majority-Black congressional district
   constitute unconstitutional racial gerrymandering, even when drawn in
   response to a federal court finding that the state’s prior single
   majority-Black district likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights
   Act?

BACKGROUND:
This case involves a challenge to Louisiana’s congressional redistricting
map, specifically focusing on District 6, alleging that the map is an
impermissible racial gerrymander. The map was created in response to a
previous lawsuit, Robinson v. Ardoin, where plaintiffs argued that the prior
map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by diluting minority votes.
To address these issues, the Louisiana Legislature adopted a new map (Senate
Bill 8) that included a second majority-Black district. However, the
plaintiffs in this case claimed that this new map violated the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by prioritizing race in its
creation. A three-judge panel concluded that District 6 of the new map did
indeed violate the Equal Protection Clause, leading the court to issue an
injunction against using this map in future elections.
