Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump (No. 24-1287)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
Does the International Emergency Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 (“IEEPA”),
   authorize the president to impose tariffs?

BACKGROUND:
Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc. are family-owned businesses
that design and distribute educational products for children. Although their
product development and some assembly occur domestically, most of their
manufacturing is outsourced to international partners, including China.
Beginning in early 2025, a series of executive orders from President Donald
J. Trump, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(“IEEPA”), imposed unprecedented tariffs on imports, including goods from
China. These included a 20% “trafficking” tariff and additional “reciprocal”
tariffs that pushed rates on Chinese goods to over 145%. Petitioners’
imports were directly affected, and complying with the new tariffs would
increase their import-related costs from $2.3 million in 2024 to over $100
million in 2025, putting their businesses at existential risk. The
petitioners filed suit on April 22, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, challenging the legality of the IEEPA tariffs. The
district court granted a preliminary injunction on May 29, 2025, holding
that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs and finding
that the tariffs posed an existential threat to the petitioners. However,
that ruling was stayed just days later, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit docketed the case. Meanwhile, the U.S.
Court of International Trade ruled similarly in related cases but its
decision was also stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit.
