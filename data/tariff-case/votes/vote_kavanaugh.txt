# PREDICTION: Justice Kavanaugh's Vote in Learning Resources v. Trump

## 1. VOTE
**REVERSE (in favor of Trump/government)** — upholding the tariffs as within presidential authority under IEEPA.

## 2. CONFIDENCE
**MEDIUM-HIGH**

The confidence is not absolute because:
- Kavanaugh has shown willingness to constrain executive overreach in domestic contexts
- The textual ambiguity and major questions doctrine create genuine cross-pressures
- His voting pattern shows he's not a reflexive government-wins voter

However, the foreign affairs/national security context, deference patterns, and statutory structure point strongly toward upholding executive authority.

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: Executive Authority in Foreign Affairs
Kavanaugh will likely anchor his reasoning in the principle from **Curtiss-Wright** (cited extensively in the briefing materials) that the President possesses inherent constitutional authority in foreign affairs, reinforced by statutory delegation. The key textual hooks:

**"Regulate...importation" (50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B)):** Kavanaugh will likely read this broadly as encompassing tariffs based on:
1. **Ordinary meaning**: "Regulate" naturally includes price-based restrictions, not just quantitative ones
2. **Functional equivalence**: If IEEPA authorizes quotas (which can reduce imports to zero), it must authorize tariffs (partial restrictions)
3. **The nine-verb spectrum**: Congress used capacious language ("investigate, regulate, direct, compel, nullify, void, prevent, prohibit") suggesting comprehensive authority

**"Quantities or...circumstances" language in the triggering provision:** This dual formulation indicates Congress contemplated threats beyond mere volume, supporting authority for tools addressing price/competitive circumstances.

### Secondary Framework: Chevron Deference (Even Post-*Loper Bright*)
While Kavanaugh joined Roberts's opinion overruling *Chevron* in *Loper Bright* (2023), he remains receptive to executive interpretations in:
- **Foreign affairs contexts** where presidential authority is strongest
- **Longstanding interpretations** (the government has maintained this reading since IEEPA's enactment)
- **Ambiguous statutes** where text genuinely admits multiple readings

Kavanaugh's *Loper Bright* concurrence emphasized courts should still respect agency expertise and reasonable constructions—just without thumb-on-scale deference. Here, the foreign policy expertise consideration weighs heavily.

### Tertiary Framework: Avoidance of Major Questions Concerns
Kavanaugh will likely distinguish this from **West Virginia v. EPA** (which he joined, dissenting from the government) because:

1. **Express delegation domain**: Unlike EPA's novel climate authority, presidential tariff power has deep historical roots (citing *Field v. Clark*, *Hampton*, and Nixon's 1971 tariffs under TWEA)
2. **Foreign affairs exception**: The major questions doctrine developed primarily for domestic regulatory overreach; Kavanaugh has never applied it to constrain presidential foreign commerce authority
3. **National security nexus**: The "emergency" predicate distinguishes this from routine economic regulation

### Rejection of Nondelegation Challenge
Kavanaugh will find the "intelligible principle" satisfied through:
- **Bounded trigger**: "Unusual and extraordinary threat" to "national security, foreign policy, or economy"
- **Notification/reporting requirements**: Procedural safeguards in IEEPA
- **Youngstown Zone 1 analysis**: Express statutory authorization plus inherent Article II authority equals maximum presidential power

Kavanaugh's approach in **Consumers' Research** (FCC, 2024, joined majority) reaffirmed intelligible principle scrutiny but upheld broad delegation with more guidance than IEEPA provides—suggesting he won't find this delegation problematic.

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### From Voting Patterns
**Foreign affairs/executive power cases:**
- Voted with government in **Trump v. Hawaii** (travel ban)
- Joined Roberts's deferential approach in **Trump v. Mazars** (subpoena, presidential authority limits)
- In **Department of Commerce v. New York** (census), Kavanaugh initially voted with the government bloc before Roberts switched
- **Biden v. Missouri** (2021): Voted to uphold CMS vaccine mandate under Spending Clause—showing deference to executive emergency authority when statutory hook exists

**Statutory interpretation approach:**
- **Loper Bright** concurrence emphasized "best reading" methodology but acknowledged ambiguity requires judgment
- In **American Hospital Ass'n v. Becerra** (2022), wrote for 9-0 Court giving "best reading" to ambiguous statutory language—here would likely find "regulate importation" includes tariffs
- **Bittner v. United States** (2023): Joined Gorsuch's narrow reading of "willful violation" in tax context, but that involved penalty-doubling, not core regulatory authority

### Critical Distinction: Domestic vs. Foreign
Kavanaugh's major questions/nondelegation skepticism appears **domain-specific**:
- **Domestic economic regulation** (EPA, OSHA vaccine mandate): Skeptical
- **Foreign affairs/national security** (travel ban, treaty interpretation): Deferential

In **Biden v. Nebraska** (student loans, 2023), Kavanaugh joined Roberts invalidating the program as exceeding HEROES Act authority—but critically, the majority emphasized the domestic nature and lack of foreign affairs/emergency predicate.

### The "Unusual and Extraordinary" Question
This is Kavanaugh's **potential swing issue**. If he agrees with challengers that 48-year trade deficits cannot be "unusual and extraordinary," he might:
- Reverse on statutory grounds (IEEPA doesn't authorize when predicate unsatisfied)
- Avoid constitutional questions entirely

However, Kavanaugh's pattern suggests he'll defer to executive determinations of "emergency" in foreign affairs contexts (see **Trump v. Hawaii** deference to national security findings). He's likely to read "unusual" as severity-based rather than novelty-based.

## 5. COALITION

**Most Likely: Joins Roberts's majority opinion** (5-4 or 6-3)

**Expected alignment:**
- Roberts (author)
- Kavanaugh
- Thomas (possibly separate concurrence on inherent Article II power)
- Alito
- Gorsuch (possibly) — though Gorsuch might write separately on nondelegation

**Potential separate writing (LOW probability):**
Kavanaugh might write a concurrence if:
1. He wants to distinguish *Loper Bright* and explain why foreign affairs context differs
2. He wants to cabin the "emergency" holding to avoid domestic implications
3. He disagrees with Thomas/Alito's broader inherent-powers reasoning

**Unlikely to join:**
- Sotomayor/Kagan/Jackson dissent (would be wildly out of pattern)
- Barrett if she takes a narrow textualist approach (but their 91% agreement rate suggests Barrett votes with Kavanaugh here)

## 6. WILDCARD FACTORS

### Reasons Prediction Could Be Wrong:

**1. Textual Conscience Override**
If Kavanaugh becomes convinced that "regulate importation" simply **cannot** bear the tariff meaning under any reasonable construction—particularly given:
- Congress's explicit use of "duties" in other tariff statutes
- Section 307's contrast (embargo statute explicitly prohibiting entry)
- Expressio unius from Section 1581(i)(3) definition

Then his textualist commitments might override foreign affairs deference. His **Bostock** approach (textualism even when consequences are unpalatable) could surface.

**2. Major Questions Doctrine Expansion**
If Kavanaugh concludes that the $5.2 trillion economic impact requires **express** congressional authorization even in foreign affairs, and reads West Virginia v. EPA's principles as universally applicable, he could flip. But this would require extending major questions into foreign commerce—a doctrinal leap he's never suggested.

**3. Coalition Dynamics with Barrett**
Barrett's influence on Kavanaugh is significant (91% agreement). If Barrett takes a narrow textualist position based on the statute's silence on "tariffs," Kavanaugh might follow. Their frequent alignment suggests her reasoning could move him.

**4. Procedural Off-Ramp**
Kavanaugh might join a narrow opinion:
- Reversing on **standing** grounds (challenging *standing* to challenge tariffs)
- Remanding on the "unusual and extraordinary" question for factual development
- Finding some
