# PREDICTION: JUSTICE GORSUCH'S VOTE IN *LEARNING RESOURCES v. TRUMP*

## 1. VOTE

**REVERSE** (siding with the importers/challengers to strike down the tariffs)

Gorsuch will vote to hold that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose these tariffs, likely joining the liberal justices plus Roberts and possibly Barrett/Kavanaugh.

## 2. CONFIDENCE

**MEDIUM-HIGH**

The textual and structural arguments against the tariffs are strong and align with Gorsuch's interpretive commitments, but the national security/foreign affairs context creates cross-pressures. The confidence is "medium-high" rather than "high" because: (1) Gorsuch has shown willingness to defer in genuine foreign affairs contexts (*Trump v. Hawaii*), (2) the government can cite *Field v. Clark* and historical practice, and (3) this implicates executive authority over foreign commerce where Gorsuch recognizes constitutional tensions.

## 3. DOCTRINAL REASONING

### Primary Framework: Textualism and the Nondelegation Canon

Gorsuch will apply **strict textualist analysis** combined with the **major questions doctrine** and **nondelegation concerns**. The critical textual hooks:

**"Regulate...importation" does not mean "impose tariffs":**
- Gorsuch embraces *noscitur a sociis* and *ejusdem generis* rigorously. The statute lists "investigate, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit" — all verbs suggesting **blocking or controlling transactions**, not **taxation**.
- The Trade Act of 1974 § 122 explicitly grants narrow tariff authority (15% cap, 150-day limit) for balance-of-payments emergencies. Reading IEEPA to grant unlimited tariff power renders § 122 superfluous, violating the whole-act rule.
- When Congress wants to authorize tariffs, it says so explicitly: § 232 references "duties" in subsection (a); IEEPA contains no such language.

**The Major Questions Doctrine applies with full force:**
- Gorsuch joined the *West Virginia v. EPA* majority requiring "clear congressional authorization" for decisions of "vast economic and political significance."
- These tariffs involve **$5.2 trillion** over 10 years (Wharton model) and fundamentally restructure trade policy — this is paradigmatic major questions territory.
- In *King v. Burwell*, Gorsuch was not yet on the Court, but his subsequent major questions votes (*NFIB v. OSHA*, *West Virginia*) show he applies the doctrine aggressively even in contexts with executive constitutional authority.

**Nondelegation as interpretive principle:**
- Even if not reaching constitutional invalidity under *Gundy*, Gorsuch will invoke nondelegation as an **interpretive clear-statement rule**. In his *Gundy* dissent (joined by Roberts and Thomas), he argued for reviving meaningful limits on delegation of legislative power.
- In *DOT v. Association of American Railroads* (2015), Gorsuch's concurrence (when he was on the Tenth Circuit) emphasized that "the Constitution does not permit Congress to delegate its legislative power to another."
- The IEEPA provides no intelligible principle limiting **which goods, which rates, which countries, or for how long** — it's a paradigmatic blank-check delegation for tariff-setting if the government's reading prevails.

### Secondary Framework: Structural Constitutionalism

**Article I, Section 8 vests tariff authority in Congress:**
- Gorsuch is highly attentive to structural constitutional boundaries. The Framers separated the power to "lay and collect...Duties" (Article I, § 8, Clause 1) from executive foreign affairs powers precisely because **tariffs are taxes on Americans**, not just foreign policy tools.
- In *Seila Law v. CFPB* (2020), Gorsuch's concurrence emphasized strict separation-of-powers formalism. He will view congressional delegation of essentially unlimited tariff authority as raising serious Article I concerns.

**Youngstown Category 3:**
- Gorsuch has cited *Youngstown* repeatedly (including in *Trump v. Mazars*). Here, Congress has **occupied the field** through the Trade Act's carefully calibrated tariff provisions. Presidential action that circumvents those limits falls in Justice Jackson's Category 3 (lowest ebb of executive authority).

### Precedential Anchors

**Cases Gorsuch will likely rely on:**

1. **Field v. Clark (1892)**: Gorsuch will distinguish this. *Field* upheld presidential authority to **suspend** tariff exemptions based on **specified factual findings** — a far cry from open-ended authority to impose any tariff for any duration based on "unusual and extraordinary threat."

2. **Algonquin (1976)**: The government's best case, but distinguishable. Section 232(b) **explicitly mentions "duties"** in subsection (a) and uses "adjust imports" in that context. IEEPA contains no parallel language. Gorsuch respects statutory distinctions.

3. **FDA v. Brown & Williamson (2000)**: Gorsuch will embrace the principle that "we must be guided...by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude." Congress doesn't hide elephants in mouseholes.

4. **King v. Burwell (2015)**: Though not yet on the Court, this established that questions of "deep economic and political significance" require express delegation. Gorsuch applied this framework in *West Virginia v. EPA*.

5. **Loving v. United States (1996)**: Gorsuch joined the Court after this, but it's instructive. Even in military justice (maximum executive deference), the Court required statutory **boundaries** on presidential discretion. IEEPA provides none for tariff levels.

**Cases that won't save the government:**

- **Curtiss-Wright (1936)**: Gorsuch is skeptical of broad "sole organ" dicta. In *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), even the Court recognized limits on presidential foreign affairs authority when Congress has legislated.
- **Dames & Moore (1981)**: Involved **specific statutory authorization** (IEEPA § 1702 for asset freezes) plus historical practice. Here, there's no specific authorization for tariffs and the practice cuts against the government (never used this way in 48 years).

## 4. KEY SIGNALS

### From Gorsuch's Prior Opinions

**Textualist rigor:**
- *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020): Gorsuch wrote that courts must apply statutory text even when it leads to results Congress might not have anticipated. Here, if "regulate importation" doesn't naturally include "impose tariffs," that's dispositive.
- *Kisor v. Wilkie* (2019) concurrence: Gorsuch argued for overruling *Auer* deference, emphasizing that "the people are entitled to know" what the law means "from reading the statute." The government's position requires inferring massive tariff authority from silence.

**Nondelegation concerns:**
- *Gundy v. United States* (2019) dissent: Gorsuch wrote a 28-page dissent arguing for a muscular nondelegation doctrine. While he lost 5-3, his reasoning applies directly here: if trade deficits persisting for **48 consecutive years** constitute "unusual and extraordinary," then "no economic circumstance fails the test"—reading the limitation out of the statute.

**Major questions skepticism:**
- *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) concurrence: Gorsuch joined the majority and wrote separately emphasizing that the major questions doctrine is rooted in nondelegation principles. He quoted approvingly from *Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute*: Congress must make the critical policy judgments itself.
- *Biden v. Nebraska* (2023): Gorsuch joined Roberts's majority applying major questions to student loan forgiveness. The same logic applies here: $5.2 trillion in tariffs is vastly more significant economically.

**Statutory structure analysis:**
- *Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis* (2018): Gorsuch's majority opinion emphasized reading statutes as coherent wholes. The Trade Act's § 122 (explicit but narrow tariff authority) cannot be rendered superfluous by reading IEEPA broadly.
