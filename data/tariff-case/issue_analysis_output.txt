# DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS: Learning Resources v. Trump / Trump v. V.O.S. Selections

## I. PRINCIPAL LEGAL QUESTIONS

### Question 1: Does IEEPA Authorize the President to Impose Tariffs?

**Textual Hook:** 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B) — does the power to "regulate... importation" include authority to impose tariffs?

**Competing Legal Theories:**

**Government's Theory:**
- "Regulate importation" is broad, capacious language that naturally encompasses tariffs as a core method of regulating imports
- Tariffs are regulatory tools (not taxes) when used to modify foreign behavior rather than raise revenue
- The nine verbs in § 1702 ("investigate, regulate, direct, compel, nullify, void, prevent, prohibit") grant a spectrum of powers
- Historical practice: President Nixon's 1971 tariffs under TWEA, upheld in *Yoshida*; Congress re-enacted same language in IEEPA two years later with awareness of that interpretation
- TWEA → IEEPA continuity: Congress carried forward TWEA's language, suggesting no intent to narrow scope

**Challengers' Theory:**
- When Congress intends to authorize tariffs, it says "tariffs" or "duties" explicitly — IEEPA contains neither term
- Structural canon: Trade Act of 1974 § 122 provides explicit, narrow tariff authority (15% cap, 150-day limit) for balance-of-payments emergencies — reading IEEPA to authorize unlimited tariffs would render § 122 superfluous
- The verbs accompanying "regulate" (nullify, void, prohibit) suggest blocking/sanctioning, not revenue-raising
- *Algonquin* distinguished: That case involved § 232 which explicitly references "duties" in subsection (a) and uses "adjust imports" in context of tariff adjustment
- Yoshida caveat: CCPA used outdated purposivist methodology, was reversed by trial court, and Congress enacted § 122 while case was pending — showing Congress didn't view TWEA as tariff authority

**Key Precedents:**
- *United States v. Yoshida Int'l, Inc.*, 526 F.2d 560 (C.C.P.A. 1975) — upheld Nixon's 1971 tariffs under TWEA
- *FDA v. Brown & Williamson*, 529 U.S. 120 (2000) — statutory structure and context defeats broad reading
- *Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC* — "adjust imports" in § 232 includes tariffs (but § 232(a) explicitly mentions duties)

**Textual Analysis Points:**

*Government emphasizes:*
- Dictionary definitions: "regulate" = "control," "govern," "direct"
- Functional equivalence: quotas (conceded) vs. tariffs both regulate import flows
- Verb spectrum: If "prohibit" (total ban) is authorized, surely "regulate" (partial restriction via price) is too

*Challengers emphasize:*
- Noscitur a sociis: "regulate" should be read in company with "nullify," "void," "prohibit" — all negative/blocking verbs
- Contrast with explicit tariff grants: Multiple statutes (§ 232, § 122, § 301) use "duties," "tariffs," "impose" when granting tariff authority
- Revenue distinction: Tariffs function as taxes on Americans; IEEPA's other tools (asset freezes, transaction blocks) target foreigners

### Question 2: Does "Unusual and Extraordinary Threat" Encompass Trade Deficits?

**Textual Hook:** 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a) — predicate requirement of "unusual and extraordinary threat"

**Competing Legal Theories:**

**Government's Theory:**
- Presidential determination entitled to deference in foreign affairs/national security
- "Unusual" = exceptional in degree/severity, not necessarily novel
- Trade deficits + structural asymmetries + fentanyl crisis = compounding emergency
- "Country-killing," threatens "bedrock" of national/economic security (President's characterization)
- Emergency can be chronic condition that reaches crisis point

**Challengers' Theory:**
- Trade deficits have persisted every year since IEEPA enacted (1977-2025) — 48 consecutive years
- "Unusual" = rare, not common; "extraordinary" = exceptional, not ordinary
- Plain meaning: A "continuing extraordinary emergency" is self-contradictory (*United States v. Garbish*, 222 U.S. 257 (1911))
- Legislative history: H.R. Rep. No. 95-459 at 10 ("emergencies are by their nature rare and brief")
- IEEPA enacted to *constrain* presidential emergency powers after TWEA abuses
- If persistent trade deficits qualify, no economic condition would fail test — reads limitation out of statute

**Key Precedents:**
- *Garbish* (1911) — "extraordinary emergency" must be special occurrence, not continuing state
- *Menominee Indian Tribe*, 577 U.S. 250 (2016) — "common circumstances" are "far from extraordinary"
- Legislative history cases (if textualists will consider): What Congress viewed as "emergency" in 1977

**Institutional Factor:** This is a question of statutory interpretation, but with national security/foreign affairs overlay. Court typically gives Executive more deference in genuine foreign policy/security emergencies, but "emergency" label itself is being contested.

### Question 3: Does the Major Questions Doctrine Apply?

**Textual Hook:** None directly — this is a judicially-created clear statement rule

**Competing Legal Theories:**

**Government's Theory:**
- MQD inapplicable or weak fit in foreign affairs context where President has inherent Article II authority
- Congress *would* naturally delegate major powers to address major international crises
- IEEPA's purpose was to grant necessary emergency powers while adding procedural controls
- Youngstown Zone 1: Express delegation + inherent authority = maximum presidential power
- *Dames & Moore* recognized IEEPA grants "sweeping and unqualified" authority

**Challengers' Theory:**
- MQD applies with *full* force to decisions of "vast economic and political significance" (*West Virginia v. EPA*)
- Tariffs = taxation = quintessential Article I power, not Article II
- Novel assertion: No President invoked IEEPA for tariffs in 48 years despite persistent trade deficits
- Economic magnitude: Wharton model estimates $5.2 trillion over 10 years, $16.4 trillion over 30 years
- Structural evasion: Reading IEEPA this way allows President to bypass Trade Act's carefully calibrated limits
- *Biden v. Nebraska* (student loans), *Alabama Assn. of Realtors* (eviction moratorium), *NFIB v. OSHA* (vaccine mandate) — all rejected broad emergency power readings

**Critical Exchange:** Justice Sotomayor pressed whether declaring foreign emergency could exempt *any* domestic policy from MQD (student loan forgiveness example). Government struggled to articulate limiting principle.

**Analytical Framework:**
- *West Virginia* factors: (1) economic/political significance; (2) lack of clear authorization; (3) novelty; (4) history of congressional regulation in area
- All four factors favor challengers
- But foreign affairs exception? Court has never applied MQD in pure foreign policy case — but this implicates *domestic* taxation authority

---

### Question 4: Does IEEPA Violate the Nondelegation Doctrine?

**Textual Hook:** Constitution Art. I, § 1 (vesting clause) + requirement for "intelligible principle"

**Competing Legal Theories:**

**Government's Theory:**
- Congress may delegate more broadly in foreign affairs where President has inherent constitutional authority
- Intelligible principle: "unusual and extraordinary threat" to "national security, foreign policy, or economy"
- Procedural constraints: declaration, Congressional notification, reporting requirements
- Historical pedigree: Founding-era delegations of foreign commerce power (e.g., 1794 embargo)
- *J.W. Hampton* — more guidance needed for narrow technical matters; less for sweeping national matters where President has expertise

**Challengers' Theory:**
- If trade deficits lasting 48 years = "unusual and extraordinary," then no economic circumstance fails test
- No standards on: which countries, which goods, what tariff rates, how long
- IEEPA provides no "general policy" or "boundaries" (*Mistretta*, *American Power & Light*)
- Tariff authority = power to tax = nondelegable legislative core
- Contrast with Trade Act § 122: 15% cap, 150-day sunset, specific predicate findings
- *Consumers' Research* (2025): FCC universal service had detailed statutory guidance on amount, beneficiaries, eligible services — IEEPA has none
- *Panama Refining*/*Schechter Poultry*: struck down delegations with no standards, no policy direction

**Critical Distinction:**
- Government: These are *regulatory* tariffs (foreign commerce power), not *revenue* tariffs (taxing power)
- Challengers: Functional reality — tariffs raise revenue from Americans, function as taxes regardless of stated purpose

**Textual Analysis:**
- Government relies on: procedural constraints as limiting principle
- Challengers rely on: substantive standards missing — "unusual and extraordinary" too vague if includes 48-year phenomenon

**Recent Precedent Trajectory:**
- *Gundy* (2019): Plurality upheld sex offender delegation (but 4 justices would have struck down)
- *Consumers' Research* (2025): Kavanaugh concurrence reaffirmed intelligible principle requirement, hinted at stricter review
- Current Court more skeptical of broad delegations than Court that decided *Whitman* (2001)

## II. SUBSIDIARY/PROCEDURAL ISSUES

### A. Remedial Question: What happens to negotiated agreements?

**Government's position:** Unwinding tariffs would:
- Breach agreements worth "trillions" with major trading partners (especially China)
- Expose U.S. to "ruthless trade retaliation"
- "Drive America from strength to failure"
- Equitable considerations counsel against retrospective invalidation

**Challengers' position:** Illegality cannot be cured by subsequent reliance or foreign expectations

**Precedent:** *Youngstown* invalidated steel seizure despite national security justification; Court rejected "equitable" rationales for illegal executive action

### B. Statutory Construction Canons

**Constitutional Avoidance:**
- Challengers: Even if statutory text ambiguous, choose reading that avoids nondelegation problem
- Government: No serious nondelegation issue to avoid

**Whole Act Rule:**
- Challengers: Reading IEEPA to authorize unlimited tariffs makes Trade Act § 122 (balance-of-payments tariffs) superfluous
- Government: Different statutes address different situations; overlap is permissible

**Reenactment Doctrine:**
- Government: Congress re-enacted "regulate importation" in 1977 IEEPA after 1975 Yoshida decision — adopted judicial interpretation
- Challengers: Congress enacted Trade Act § 122 in 1974 *while Yoshida pending* — shows Congress didn't think TWEA authorized tariffs

**Clear Statement Rules:**
- Government: None apply in foreign affairs context
- Challengers: Multiple clear statement rules (MQD, constitutional avoidance, federalism if states injured) require explicit authorization

### C. TWEA History and 1977 Reform

**Legislative History Context:**
- TWEA (1917): Wartime statute, allowed presidential emergency declarations
- Nixon (1971): Used TWEA for peacetime balance-of-payments tariff
- IEEPA (1977): Reformed TWEA, limited to declared national emergencies
- Congressional intent: H.R. Rep. No. 95-459 says purpose was to "revise and delimit" presidential authority, make powers "more limited in scope"

**Competing Narratives:**
- Government: Congress kept same operative language ("regulate importation"), signaling no change in scope
- Challengers: Congress changed triggering conditions precisely to constrain when powers could be used

**Justice Jackson's probing:** Why would Congress enact statute to *constrain* presidential power, then interpret it to grant *unlimited* tariff authority?

## III. KEY TEXTUAL BATTLEGROUNDS

### 1. "Regulate Importation" (§ 1702(a)(1)(B))

**Government's semantic arguments:**
- "Regulate" = control, govern, prescribe rules for
- "Importation" = the act of bringing goods into country
- Tariffs regulate by making importation more expensive
- Quotas regulate by limiting quantity → tariffs regulate by limiting through price

**Challengers' semantic arguments:**
- "Regulate" in context of other verbs (nullify, void, prohibit) = control via restriction/prohibition
- Tariffs don't regulate import *process*, they tax import *transactions*
- "Importation" = logistical act of entry, not commercial terms
- Congress knows how to say "impose duties on imports" when it means that

### 2. Revenue vs. Regulation Distinction

**Government's theory:**
- Purpose determines characterization
- These tariffs aim to change foreign behavior (regulatory purpose)
- Revenue is "incidental" — tariffs most effective if never paid (because foreign conduct changes)
- Compare: embargo (concededly authorized) → partial embargo = high tariff

**Challengers' theory:**
- Function determines characterization
- Tariffs extract money from American importers = tax
- Wharton estimates $5.2 trillion revenue → not "incidental"
- President described as raising "trillions and trillions" for domestic programs (childcare)
- Can't transform tax into regulation by labeling

**Constitutional Hook:**
- Article I, § 8, Clause 1: "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises"
- "Duties" and "Imposts" historically = tariffs
- Framers separately listed these to ensure Congress controlled

### 3. "Unusual and Extraordinary Threat" (§ 1701(a))

**Dictionary definitions** (1977 era):
- "Unusual" = not usual, rare, exceptional
- "Extraordinary" = beyond ordinary, exceptional, out of usual course

**Government's reading:**
- Focuses on severity: threat has become extraordinary in magnitude
- Emergent quality: situation reaching breaking point ("brink of catastrophe")
- Multi-causal: trade deficits + fentanyl + structural asymmetries = unusual combination

**Challengers' reading:**
- Focuses on novelty/departure from norm
- Persistent trade deficits = usual and ordinary by definition
- 48 consecutive years = paradigmatic "continuing emergency" that *Garbish* forbids

**Practical limiting principle:**
- Government's test: If very serious, qualifies
- Challengers' test: If longstanding/chronic, disqualifies

---

## IV. ARTICLE II POWERS DEBATE

**Government's Foreign Affairs Authority Claim:**

**Textual basis:**
- Article II, § 2: Commander in Chief, treaty power, ambassadors
- Article II, § 3: receive ambassadors, "take Care" clause
- Structural inference: Executive power over external affairs

**Precedents invoked:**
- *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.*, 299 U.S. 304 (1936) — "plenary and exclusive power of the President as sole organ"
- *Department of Navy v. Egan*, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) — "President's authority to conduct foreign relations"
- *Garamendi* — executive agreements in foreign affairs
- *Dames & Moore* — IEEPA grants "sweeping" authority

**Challengers' response:**
- Foreign commerce ≠ foreign relations
- *Youngstown* Zone 3: Where Congress has occupied field (Trade Act), President at "lowest ebb"
- Article I, § 8, Clause 3 expressly vests foreign commerce regulation in Congress
- Tariffs = taxes = domestic impact on Americans, not pure foreign policy
- *Curtiss-Wright*'s dicta overstated; later cases recognize Congress's foreign commerce authority

**Justice Kagan's challenge:** "Tariffs... are the power to impose taxes, the power to regulate foreign commerce. These are not things that are thought of as Article II powers. They are quintessential Article I powers."

**Analytical Framework:**
- *Youngstown* tripartite test:
  - Zone 1 (strongest): Congressional authorization + inherent power
  - Zone 2 (twilight): Congressional silence
  - Zone 3 (weakest): Congressional prohibition
- Government claims Zone 1 (IEEPA authorization + foreign affairs authority)
- Challengers claim Zone 3 (Trade Act occupies field, IEEPA doesn't authorize)

## V. PROCEDURAL/INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS

### A. Recusal Considerations

**None apparent.** All nine justices participated in oral argument. No obvious conflicts.
