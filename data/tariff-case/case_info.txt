Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump (No. 24-1287)
Consolidated with Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. (No. 25-250)

QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
1. Whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes 
   the President to impose tariffs.
2. If IEEPA authorizes the tariffs, whether the statute unconstitutionally 
   delegates legislative authority to the President.

BACKGROUND:
In April 2025, President Trump declared an economic state of emergency and 
imposed sweeping tariffs on imported goods under IEEPA, including a minimum 
10% tariff on most imports and higher rates on specific countries (e.g., 
China, Canada, Mexico). Learning Resources and other importers challenged 
the tariffs. The Court of International Trade ruled against the government, 
and the Federal Circuit affirmed in a 7-4 en banc decision, holding that 
IEEPA does not authorize tariffs of this magnitude. The Supreme Court 
granted certiorari before judgment and consolidated the cases.

Argued: November 5, 2025
Decision expected: Late spring / early summer 2026

KEY LEGAL ISSUES:
- Plain text of IEEPA: does "regulate ... importation" include imposing tariffs?
- Relationship between IEEPA and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA)
- Whether TWEA's wartime tariff authority carried over to peacetime IEEPA
- Major questions doctrine applicability
- Nondelegation concerns
- Historical practice of presidential tariff authority
- Youngstown framework for separation of powers analysis
